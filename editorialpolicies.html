    <h3>Copyright Notice</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Authors who publish with this press agree to the following terms:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Authors retain copyright and grant the press right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this press.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Authors are free to make their work available elsewhere (e.g. a repository or an anthology), but only under a non-exclusive license. We appreciate if credit to the initial publication is given.</li>
        <br />
        <li>Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work (See 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://opcit.eprints.org/oacitation-biblio.html">The Effect of Open Access</a>).</li>

  <div id="peerReviewProcess">
    <h3>Peer Review Process</h3>
    <p>Book manuscripts are peer-reviewed by at least two reviewers who are selected by the respective series editors. For edited volumes this review may be skipped provided the contributions in the volume have been peer-reviewed and the review process is documented. 
    <br />
    <br />A manuscript can be accepted or rejected. There is no revise and resubmit, but rejected manuscripts can be resubmitted after a year. If a book is not accepted 6 months after submission, it counts as rejected.
    <br />
    <br />Please refer to the 
    <a href="http://langsci-press.org/public/downloads/LangSci_Guidelines.pdf">Guidelines</a>for details of the reviewing procedure.</p>
