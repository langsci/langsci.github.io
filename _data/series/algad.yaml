aimsandscope: "African Languages are still among some of the least documented languages in the world. One of the aims of this series is to contribute to rectifying this state of affairs by focusing on the description, analysis, and documentation of languages within the African continent and contact languages within the African Diaspora. A distinctive aspect of this series is that each contribution is either (i) a comprehensive grammar, along with a (bilingual) lexicon as an appendix or (ii) a comprehensive monolingual or bilingual dictionary along with a sketch of the grammar of the language in question as an appendix. In this way different linguists of different specializations and interests, whether they are descriptive, theoretical linguists or lexicographers, would be given the opportunity to make substantial contributions from their particular area of specialization towards documenting, preserving, and revitalizing African languages. As a second aim, even for African languages that are already quite well documented, our editors will recruit scholars well versed in contemporary linguistic theories and descriptive techniques to write newer and updated grammars of these African languages that have existing grammars, dictionaries and other resources."

        blurb: This book is the first comprehensive monograph dedicated to Chakali, a Southwestern Grusi language spoken by less than 3500 people in northwest Ghana. The dictionary offers a consistent description of word meaning and provides the basis for future research in the linguistic area. It is also designed to provide an inventory of correspondence with English usage in a reversal index. The concepts used in the dictionary are explained in a grammar outline, which is of interest to specialists in Gur and Grusi linguistics, as well as any language researchers working in this part of the world.
