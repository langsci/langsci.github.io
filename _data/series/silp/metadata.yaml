aimsandscope: "This series aims to publish high quality books that contribute to a better understanding of linguistic theories of phonetics and phonology. It aims to strengthen the scientific foundation of phonological theory using methods from phonetics and related disciplines, such as psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, computer science and physics. This integrated approach underlines the importance of the relation between qualitative and quantitative aspects of speech and language, as well as the relevance of prosody in its broadest sense."
