aimsandscope: 'This series will publish book-length studies on language variation including studies in dialectology; sociolinguistics, the diffusion of linguistic variants, contact varieties, including (semi-)independent colonial varieties such as "World Englishes"; and naturally studies incorporating both social and geographical influences on variation. We are interested in variation at every linguistic level from phonetics to discourse, and we are particularly eager to attract studies which are based on large and rigorously analyzed datasets. Studies aiming to tap new media as data sources are emphatically welcome. We likewise look forward to studies which emphasize on the one hand the links to other cultural studies such as archaeology, sociology, population genetics and human geography, or on the other hand perspectives from other linguistics sub-disciplines such as historical linguistics, typology, multilingualism, or corpus linguistics.'
