aimsandscope: "This book series will publish book-length studies on individual less-widely studied languages (especially, but not only reference grammars), as well as works in broadly comparative typological linguistics that takes into account the world-wide diversity of human languages. Work on individual languages and broadly comparative work is of a different nature, but this book series sees the two as closely related: Comparative studies need in-depth work on individual languages from around the world to build on, and descriptive work is done best in a comparative perspective."
