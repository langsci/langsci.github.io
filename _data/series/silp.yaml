aimsandscope: "This series aims to publish high quality books that contribute to a better understanding of linguistic theories of phonetics and phonology. It aims to strengthen the scientific foundation of phonological theory using methods from phonetics and related disciplines, such as psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, computer science and physics. This integrated approach underlines the importance of the relation between qualitative and quantitative aspects of speech and language, as well as the relevance of prosody in its broadest sense."

        blurb: Recent findings on phonetic detail have been taken as supporting exemplar-based approaches to prosody. Through four experiments on both production and perception of both melodic and temporal detail in Neapolitan Italian, we show that prosodic detail is not incompatible with abstractionist approaches either. Specifically, we suggest that the exploration of prosodic detail leads to a refined understanding of the relationships between the richly specified and continuous varying phonetic information on one side, and coarse phonologically structured contrasts on the other, thus offering insights on how pragmatic information is conveyed by prosody.
