blurb: This book is the first comprehensive monograph dedicated to Chakali, a Southwestern
  Grusi language spoken by less than 3500 people in northwest Ghana. The dictionary
  offers a consistent description of word meaning and provides the basis for future
  research in the linguistic area. It is also designed to provide an inventory of
  correspondence with English usage in a reversal index. The concepts used in the
  dictionary are explained in a grammar outline, which is of interest to specialists
  in Gur and Grusi linguistics, as well as any language researchers working in this
  part of the world.
