blurb: "This volume contains the complete collection of published and unpublished\
  \ work on German grammar by Tilman N. H\xF6hle. It consists of two parts. The first\
  \ part is <em>Topologische Felder</em>, a book-length manuscript that was written\
  \ in 1983 but was never finished nor published. It is a careful examination of the\
  \ topological properties of German sentences, including a discussion of typological\
  \ assumptions. The second part assembles all other published and unpublished papers\
  \ by H\xF6hle on German grammar.<br><br>All of these papers were highly influential\
  \ in German linguistics, in theoretical linguistics in general, and in a specific\
  \ variant of theoretical linguistics, Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar. Topics\
  \ covered are clause structure, constituent order, coordination, (verum) focus,\
  \ word structure, the relationship between relative pronouns and verbs in V2, extraction,\
  \ and the foundations of a theory of phonology in constraint-based grammar.\r\n\
  This book is a revised version of <a href=\"http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/149\"\
  >http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/149</a>\r\nAs per legal requirement, we state\
  \ that this book is available in Germany for 55 EUR."
