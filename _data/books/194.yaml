  \ the invariance of meaning has, partly due to practical constraints, rarely been\
  \ challenged in Corpus-based Translation Studies. In answer to this, the aim of\
  \ this book is to question the invariance of meaning in translated texts: if translation\
  \ scholars agree on the fact that translated language is</span></span> <span style=\"\
  font-family: Times\\ New\\ Roman, serif;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">different from non-translated\
  \ language with respect to a number of grammatical and lexical aspects, would it\
  \ be possible to identify differences between translated and non-translated language\
  \ on the semantic level too? More specifically, this books tries to formulate an\
  \ answer to the following three questions: (i) how can semantic differences in translated\
  \ vs non-translated language be investigated in a corpus-based study?, (ii) are\
  \ there any differences on the semantic level between translated and non-translated\
  \ language? and (iii) if there are differences on the semantic level, can we ascribe\
  \ them to any of the (universal) tendencies of translation? In this book, I establish\
  \ a way to visually explore semantic similarity on the basis of representations\
  \ of translated and non-translated semantic fields. A </span></span><span lang=\"\
