blurb: This book consists of contributions related to the definition, representation
  and parsing of MWEs. These reflect current trends in the representation and processing
  of MWEs. They cover various categories of MWEs such as verbal, adverbial and nominal
  MWEs, various linguistic frameworks (e.g. tree-based and unification-based grammars),
  various languages including English, French, Modern Greek, Hebrew, Norwegian), and
  various applications (namely MWE detection, parsing, automatic translation) using
  both symbolic and statistical approaches.
