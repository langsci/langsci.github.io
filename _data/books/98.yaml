blurb: "This book is a dictionary and grammar sketch of Ik, one of the three Kuliak\
  \ (Rub) languages spoken in the beautiful Karamoja region of northeastern Uganda.\
  \ It is the lexicographic sequel to <em>A grammar of Ik (Ic\xE9-t\xF3d): Northeast\
  \ Uganda\x92s last thriving Kuliak language</em> (Schrock 2014). The present volume\
  \ includes an Ik-English dictionary with roughly 8,700 entries, followed by a reversed\
  \ English-Ik index. These two main sections are then supplemented with an outline\
  \ of Ik grammar that is comprehensive in its coverage of topics and written in a\
  \ simple style, using standard linguistic terminology in a way that is accessible\
  \ to interested non-linguists as well. This book may prove useful for language preservation\
  \ and development among the Ik people, as a reference tool for non-Ik learners of\
  \ the language, and as a source of data, not only for the comparative study of Kuliak\
  \ but also the wider Afroasiatic and Nilo-Saharan language families."
