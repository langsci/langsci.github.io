blurb: '<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in;" align="justify"><em>African
  Linguistics on the Prairie</em>&nbsp;features select revised peer-reviewed papers
  from the 45<sup>th</sup> Annual Conference on African Linguistics, held at the University
  of Kansas. The articles in this volume reflect the enormous diversity of African
  languages, as they focus on languages from all of the major African language phyla.&nbsp;
  The articles here also reflect the many different research perspectives that frame
  the work of linguists in the Association for Contemporary African Linguistics. The
  diversity of views presented in this volume are thus indicative of the vitality
  of current African linguistics research. The work presented in this volume represents
  both descriptive and theoretical methodologies and covers fields ranging from phonetics,
  phonology, morphology, typology, syntax, and semantics to sociolinguistics, discourse
  analysis, language acquisition, computational linguistics and beyond.&nbsp; This
  broad scope and the quality of the articles contained within holds out the promise
  of continued advancement in linguistic research on African languages.'
