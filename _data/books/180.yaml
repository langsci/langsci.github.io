blurb: "This book deals with the effects of three different learning contexts mainly\
  \ on adult, but also on adolescent, learners\x92 language acquisition. The three\
  \ contexts brought together in the monograph include i) a conventional instructed\
  \ second language acquisition (ISLA) environment, in which learners receive formal\
  \ instruction in English as a Foreign Language (EFL); ii) a Study Abroad (SA) context,\
  \ which learners experience during mobility programmes, when the target language\
  \ is no longer a foreign but a second language learnt in a naturalistic context;\
  \ iii) the immersion classroom, also known as an integrated content and language\
  \ (ICL) setting, in which learners are taught content subjects through the medium\
  \ of the target language\x97more often than not English, used as the Lingua Franca\
  \ (ELF).\r\nThe volume examines how these contexts change language learners\x92\
  \ linguistic performance, and also non-linguistic, that is, it throws light on how\
  \ motivation, sense of identity, interculturality, international ethos, and affective\
  \ factors develop. To our knowledge, no publication exists which places the three\
  \ contexts on focus in this monograph along a continuum, as suggested in P\xE9rez-Vidal\
  \ (2011, 2014), with SA as \x91the most naturalistic\x92 context on one extreme,\
  \ ISLA on the other, and ICL somewhere in between, while framing them all as international\
  \ classrooms. Concerning target languages, the nine chapters included in the volume\
  \ analyze English, and one chapter deals with Spanish, as the target language. As\
  \ for target countries in SA programmes, data include England, Ireland, France,\
  \ Germany, and Spain in Europe, but also Canada, China, and Australia. While the\
  \ main bulk of the chapters deal with tertiary level language learners, a language\
  \ learning population which has received less attention by research thus far, one\
  \ chapter deals with adolescent learners.\r\nCarmen P\xE9rez-Vidal, Sonia L\xF3\
  pez, Jennifer Ament and Dakota Thomas-Wilhelm all served on the organizing committee\
  \ for the EUROSLA workshop held at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, in May\
  \ 2016. It is from this workshop that this monograph was inspired"
