blurb: "This text is a practical guide for linguists, and programmers, who work with\
  \ data in multilingual computational environments. We introduce the basic concepts\
  \ needed to understand how writing systems and character encodings function, and\
  \ how they work together at the intersection between the Unicode Standard and the\
  \ International Phonetic Alphabet. Although these standards are often met with frustration\
  \ by users, they nevertheless provide language researchers and programmers with\
  \ a consistent computational architecture needed to process, publish and analyze\
  \ lexical data from the world's languages. Thus we bring to light common, but not\
  \ always transparent, pitfalls which researchers face when working with Unicode\
  \ and IPA. Having identified and overcome these pitfalls involved in making writing\
  \ systems and character encodings syntactically and semantically interoperable (to\
  \ the extent that they can be), we created a suite of open-source Python and R tools\
  \ to work with languages using orthography profiles that describe author- or document-specific\
  \ orthographic conventions. In this cookbook we describe a formal specification\
  \ of orthography profiles and provide recipes using open source tools to show how\
  \ users can segment text, analyze it, identify errors, and to transform it into\
  \ different written forms for comparative linguistics research.\r\nThis book is\
  \ a prime example of open publishing as envisioned by Language Science Press. It\
  \ is open access, has accompanying open source software, has open peer review, versioning\
  \ and so on. Read more in this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://userblogs.fu-berlin.de/langsci-press/2018/07/11/what-it-means-to-be-open-and-community-based-the-unicode-cookbook-as-a-showcase/\"\

  - [Steven, '', Moran, '<p>Steven Moran is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department
      of Comparative Linguistics, University of Zurich. He has a broad background
      in computational linguistics and works with data from under-resourced and endangered
      languages to answer research questions regarding worldwide linguistic diversity
      and language evolution. He focuses on phonology, language acquisition, and historical-comparative
      linguistics. He also does linguistic fieldwork in West Africa.</p>']
  - [Michael, '', Cysouw, '<p>Michael Cysouw is Professor of language typology at
      the Philipps University Marburg. His research interests are broad-scale investigations
      of the world''s linguistic diversity, with a particular fondness for unusual
      structures from a worldwide perspective. He focusses not only on the content
      of linguistic diversity, but also on the methodological aspects of doing cross-linguistic
      research. In his research, language comparison is taken both as a window into
      language universals (focussing on aspects on which languages do not differ)
      as well as historical reconstruction (by interpreting differences between languages
      as the result of historical processes).</p>']
