blurb: "This book tackles the divisive question of the Stative/Non-stative distinction\
  \ by going straight to the root of the lexical items that have been at the heart\
  \ of this discussion. It provides an analysis of property items (Dual Aspectual\
  \ Forms) couched in the syntax-semantics interface eliminating the false dichotomy\
  \ at the base of the controversy in the field and the suggestion that a lexical\
  \ item needs be unambiguously Stative or Non-stative. What we see in this work is\
  \ theoretical grounding for a flexible group of lexical items comprising both verbs\
  \ and adjectives underlyingly with allowances made for derivation into either category.\
  \ The result is a work that is conceptually and theoretically appealing and one\
  \ that brings consensus.\r\n<!--This work focuses on the matter of \x91dual aspectual\
  \ forms\x92 and the general group of property items in Caribbean English Creoles\
  \ (CECs). Focus on this group of lexical items including items such as sik \x91\
  sick\x92 weeri \x91tired\x92 redi \x91ready\x92 etc, which appear in both Stative\
  \ and Non-stative use, is important in dealing with the conceptual question that\
  \ has been raised for the Stative/Non-Stative distinction and whether it may unambiguously\
  \ be applied to verbs. In this work, which is couched in current thinking on lexical\
  \ aspect and event structure representation of predicates, I show that the existence\
  \ of \x91dual aspectual\x92 forms in Caribbean English Creoles (CECs) does not refute\
  \ the Stative/Non-stative distinction. From the perspective of primitive Event Structures\
  \ and Pustejovsky\x92s (1988; 1991) observation of a verb\x92s association with\
  \ an Event Structure of State, Transition or Process, I propose for CEC property\
  \ items a classification based on a combination of both syntactic and semantic criteria.\
  \ The analysis I propose effectively allows for a classification of property items\
  \ which includes three main groups: Those items which are inherently Non-stative\
  \ (Transition), those that are inherently Stative (State) and do not appear in Non-stative\
  \ use and those that are inherently Stative (State) but allow for morphological\
  \ derivation to express the Event Structure of either Transition or Process. This\
  \ study reconciles the apparently contrasting views of authors discussed in this\
  \ work and, importantly, provides theoretical grounding; rather than an either or\
  \ analysis of this group of items as verbs or adjectives, the findings of this study\
  \ point to a flexible group comprising both verbs and adjectives underlyingly. However,\
  \ allowance is made for possible derivation of these to appear in either category.\
  \ The study effectively shifts focus from the previously purely syntactic criteria\
  \ that have been established in the treatment of these forms and points to focus\
  \ on the syntax-semantics interface where both syntactic and semantic information\
  \ interact in predicting and governing the behaviour of lexical items.-->"
