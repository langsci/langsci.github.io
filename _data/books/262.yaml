blurb: "The standard view of the form-meaning interfaces, as embraced by the great\
  \ majority of contemporary grammatical frameworks, consists in the assumption that\
  \ meaning can be associated with grammatical form in a one-to-one correspondence.\
  \ Under this view, composition is quite straightforward, involving concatenation\
  \ of form, paired with functional application in meaning. In this book, we discuss\
  \ linguistic phenomena across several grammatical sub-modules (morphology, syntax,\
  \ semantics) that apparently pose a problem to the standard view, mapping out the\
  \ potential for deviation from the ideal of one-to-one correspondences, and develop\
  \ formal accounts of the range of phenomena. We argue that a constraint-based perspective\
  \ is particularly apt to accommodate deviations from one-to-many correspondences,\
  \ as it allows us to impose constraints on full structures (such as a complete word\
  \ or the interpretation of a full sentence) instead of deriving such structures\
  \ step by step.\r\nMost of the papers in this volume are formulated in a particular\
  \ constraint-based grammar framework, Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar. The\
  \ contributions investigate how the lexical and constructional aspects of this theory\
  \ can be combined to provide an answer to this question across different linguistic\
  \ sub-theories."
