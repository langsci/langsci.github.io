blurb: "This volume addresses the phenomenon of verb alternation in Mauritian, a French-based\
  \ creole spoken on the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, detailing for the\
  \ first time their complex distribution as used in lexeme-formation, in syntax and\
  \ in the encoding of information-structural relations. Mauritian long and short\
  \ verb forms, hitherto considered purely phonological, is here analyzed as a purely\
  \ morphological alternation, that is, one which despite being neither phonologically\
  \ predictable nor featurally coherent is unquestionably systemic. The analysis appeals\
  \ to empirical evidence that the author mostly collected herself, covering among\
  \ other types of contributions, sociohistorical factors, diachronic sources, lexical\
  \ databases and corpora, to provide a comprehensive account of the reorganization\
  \ of the lexifier\x92s verb system and its subsequent exaptation in Mauritian. In\
  \ the process, Fabiola Henri offers a novel perspective of morphological change\
  \ and complexity in creoles using insights from implicative word and paradigm approaches\
  \ to morphology."

      \ insights from both information-theoretic and discriminative learning. Additional\
      \ areas of investigation are syntax, semantics and information-structure. Her\

      \ on linguistic complexity which starkly contrasts with \x91exceptionalist\x92\
