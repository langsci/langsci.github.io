blurb: "<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;\"><strong>This edition is\
  \ superseded by the <a href=\"http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/157\">second\
  \ edition</a>.</strong>\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;\">The\
  \ Alor-Pantar family constitutes the westernmost outlier group of Papuan (Non-Austronesian)\
  \ languages. Its twenty or so languages are spoken on the islands of Alor and Pantar,\
  \ located just north of Timor, in eastern Indonesia. Together with the Papuan languages\
  \ of Timor, they make up the Timor-Alor-Pantar family. The languages average 5,000\
  \ speakers and are under pressure from the local Malay variety as well as the national\
  \ language, Indonesian.\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;\">This\
  \ volume studies the internal and external linguistic history of this interesting\
  \ group, and showcases some of its unique typological features, such as the preference\
  \ to index the transitive patient-like argument on the verb but not the agent-like\
  \ one; the extreme variety in morphological alignment patterns; the use of plural\
  \ number words; the existence of quinary numeral systems; the elaborate spatial\
  \ deictic systems involving an elevation component; and the great variation exhibited\
  \ in their kinship systems.\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;\"\
  >Unlike many other Papuan languages, Alor-Pantar languages do not exhibit clause-chaining,\
  \ do not have switch reference systems, never suffix subject indexes to verbs, do\
  \ not mark gender, but do encode clusivity in their pronominal systems. Indeed,\
  \ apart from a broadly similar head-final syntactic profile, there is little else\
  \ that the Alor-Pantar languages share with Papuan languages spoken in other regions.\
  \ While all of them show some traces of contact with Austronesian languages, in\
  \ general, borrowing from Austronesian has not been intense, and contact with Malay\
  \ and Indonesian is a relatively recent phenomenon in most of the Alor-Pantar region."
