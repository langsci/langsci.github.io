blurb: "<p class=\"western\" style=\"margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height:\
  \ 100%;\"><em>Diversity in African Languages</em> contains a selection of revised\
  \ papers from the 46th Annual Conference on African Linguistics, held at the University\
  \ of Oregon. Most chapters focus on single languages, addressing diverse aspects\
  \ of their phonology, morphology, semantics, syntax, information structure, or historical\
  \ development. These chapters represent nine different genera: Mande, Gur, Kwa,\
  \ Edoid, Bantu, Nilotic, Gumuzic, Cushitic, and Omotic. Other chapters investigate\
  \ a mix of languages and families, moving from typological issues to sociolinguistic\
  \ and inter-ethnic factors that affect language and accent switching. Some chapters\
  \ are primarily descriptive, while others push forward the theoretical understanding\
  \ of tone, semantic problems, discourse related structures, and other linguistic\
  \ systems. The papers on Bantu languages reflect something of the internal richness\
  \ and continued fascination of the family for linguists, as well as maturation of\
  \ research on the family. The distribution of other papers highlights the need for\
  \ intensified research into all the language families of Africa, including basic\
  \ documentation, in order to comprehend linguistic diversities and convergences\
  \ across the continent. In this regard, the chapter on Daats\x92i?in (Gumuzic) stands\
  \ out as the first-ever published article on this hitherto unknown and endangered\
  \ language found in the Ethiopian-Sudanese border lands."
