blurb: "<p class=\"p1\">In this book, I propose a grammar fragment which accounts\
  \ for the main properties of two elliptical constructions (\x91lacking\x92 for the\
  \ verbal head) called <em>gapping</em> (1a) and <em>verbless relative adjuncts</em>\
  \ (therefore, VRA) (1b) respectively.\r\n<p class=\"p1\">(1) a. Jean aime les pommes\
  \ [<strong>et</strong>&nbsp;Marie les bananes]. 'Jean likes apples and Maria bananas'&nbsp;\r\
  \n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b. Plusieurs personnes sont venues cette semaine,\
  \ [<strong>dont</strong>&nbsp;Marie (hier)]. 'Several people have come this week,\
  \ among which Marie yesterday'\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We mainly argue for the fact that\
  \ elliptical clauses in gapping and VRA constructions don\x92t behave as regular\
  \ verbal clauses. Their syntactic and semantic properties don\x92t provide evidence\
  \ for deriving this kind of elliptical clause from a complete clause. An analysis\
  \ in terms of syntactic reconstruction of the missing material is therefore inadequate.\
  \ Thus, the elliptical clause in both constructions (gapping and VRA) has a specific\
  \ syntactic behaviour and must be assigned an independent status in the grammar,\
  \ more precisely the status of a <em>fragmentary clause</em>, that is a syntactic\
  \ unit having a propositional content of message type, but an incomplete syntax.\
  \ This dissertation gives new arguments in favor of a semantic reconstruction with\
  \ parallelism constraints, cf. Ginzburg &amp; Sag (2000), Culicover &amp; Jackendoff\
  \ (2005)."
