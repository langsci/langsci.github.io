blurb: "In English, phonological double consonants only occur across morphological\
  \ boundaries, for example, in affixation (e.g. in unnatural, innumerous). There\
  \ are two possibilities for the phonetic realization of these morphological geminates:\
  \ Either the phonological double is realized with a longer duration than a phonological\
  \ singleton (gemination), or it is of the same duration as a singleton consonant\
  \ (degemination).\r\nThe present book provides the first large-scale empirical study\
  \ on the gemination with the five English affixes <em>un</em>-, locative <em>in</em>-,\
  \ negative <em>in</em>-, <em>dis</em>- and -<em>ly</em>. Using corpus and experimental\
  \ data, the predictions of various approaches to the morpho-phonological and the\
  \ morpho-phonetic interface are tested. By finding out which approach can account\
  \ best for the gemination pattern of English affixed words, important implications\
  \ about the interplay between morphology, phonology and phonetics are drawn."
