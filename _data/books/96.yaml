blurb: "Dependency is a fundamental concept in the analysis of linguistic systems.\
  \ The many if-then statements offered in typology and grammar-writing imply a causally\
  \ real notion of dependency that is central to the claim being made\x97usually with\
  \ reference to widely varying timescales and types of processes. But despite the\
  \ importance of the concept of dependency in our work, its nature is seldom defined\
  \ or made explicit. This book brings together experts on language, representing\
  \ descriptive linguistics, language typology, functional/cognitive linguistics,\
  \ cognitive science, research on gesture and other semiotic systems, developmental\
  \ psychology, psycholinguistics, and linguistic anthropology to address the following\
  \ question: What kinds of dependencies exist among language-related systems, and\
  \ how do we define and explain them in natural, causal terms?"
