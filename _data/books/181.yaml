blurb: "The purpose of this volume is to explore key issues, approaches and challenges\
  \ to quality in institutional translation by confronting academics\x92 and practitioners\x92\
  \ perspectives. What the reader will find in this book is an interplay of two approaches:\
  \ academic contributions providing the conceptual and theoretical background for\
  \ discussing quality on the one hand, and chapters exploring selected aspects of\
  \ quality and case studies from both academics and practitioners on the other. Our\
  \ aim is to present these two approaches as a breeding ground for testing one vis-\xE0\
  -vis the other.\r\nThis book studies institutional translation mostly through the\
  \ lens of the European Union (EU) reality, and, more specifically, of EU institutions\
  \ and bodies, due to the unprecedented scale of their multilingual operations and\
  \ the legal and political importance of translation. Thus, it is concerned with\
  \ the supranational (international) level, deliberately leaving national and other\
  \ contexts aside. Quality in supranational institutions is explored both in terms\
  \ of translation processes and their products \x96 the translated texts."
