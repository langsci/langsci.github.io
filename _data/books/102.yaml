blurb: 'Contrastive Linguistics (CL), Translation Studies (TS) and Machine Translation
  (MT) have common grounds: They all work at the crossroad where two or more languages
  meet. Despite their inherent relatedness, methodological exchange between the three
  disciplines is rare. This special issue touches upon areas where the three fields
  converge. It results directly from a workshop at the 2011 German Association for
  Language Technology and Computational Linguistics (GSCL) conference in Hamburg where
  researchers from the three fields presented and discussed their interdisciplinary
  work. While the studies contained in this volume draw from a wide variety of objectives
  and methods, and various areas of overlaps between CL, TS and MT are addressed,
  the volume is by no means exhaustive with regard to this topic. Further cross-fertilisation
  is not only desirable, but almost mandatory in order to tackle future tasks and
  endeavours, and this volume is committed to bringing these three fields even closer
  together.'
