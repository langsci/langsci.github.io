blurb: "<em>Communication and content</em> presents a comprehensive and foundational\
  \ account of meaning based on new versions of situation theory and game theory.\
  \ The literal and implied meanings of an utterance are derived from first principles\
  \ assuming little more than the partial rationality of interacting agents. New analyses\
  \ of a number of diverse phenomena\x97a wide notion of ambiguity encompassing phonetics,\
  \ syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and beyond, vagueness, convention and conventional\
  \ meaning, Frege\x92s puzzle of informative identities, semantic change, translation,\
  \ and definitions of communication, speaker meaning, and reference\x97are developed.\
  \ Frege\x92s context and compositional principles are generalized and reconciled\
  \ in a fixed point principle and a detailed critique of Grice and some aspects of\
  \ the Romantic conception of meaning are offered. The book will be of interest to\
  \ scholars in philosophy, linguistics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science.\
  \ It should also interest readers in related fields like literary and art criticism\
  \ and those involved in applications of game theory to other fields."
