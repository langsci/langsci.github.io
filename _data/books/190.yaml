blurb: This volume is the first in what hopefully will be a growing set of edited
  volumes and monographs concerning Niger-Congo comparative studies. This first volume
  addresses matters that are relevant to the entire East Benue-Congo family as well
  as the particular branches Kainji, Plateau, and Bantoid. In the case of Bantoid,
  the particular focus is on Grassfields and the Grassfields-Bantu borderland, though
  other Bantoid subgroups are referenced. The potential topics for comparative studies
  among these languages are numerous, but this volume is dedicated to presentations
  on nominal affixes, third person pronouns, and verbal extensions. A forthcoming
  volume will provide some results of reconstructions and lexicostatistics in Cross
  River, exploratory reconstructions in Southern Jukunoid, and reconstructions in
  Ekoid-Mbe and Mambiloid.
