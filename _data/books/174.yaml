blurb: This study investigates the distribution of linguistic and specifically structural
  diversity in Northeast Asia (NEA), defined as the region north of the Yellow River
  and east of the Yenisei. In particular, it analyzes what is called the grammar of
  questions (GQ), i.e., those aspects of any given language that are specialized for
  asking questions or regularly combine with these. The bulk of the study is a bottom-up
  description and comparison of GQs in the languages of NEA. The addition of the phrase
  <em>and beyond </em>to the title of this study serves two purposes. First, languages
  such as Turkish and Chuvash are included, despite the fact that they are spoken
  outside of NEA, since they have ties to (or even originated in) the region. Second,
  despite its focus on one area, the typology is intended to be applicable to other
  languages as well. Therefore, it makes extensive use of data from languages outside
  of NEA. The restriction to one category is necessary for reasons of space and clarity,
  and the process of zooming in on one region allows a higher resolution and historical
  accuracy than is usually the case in linguistic typology. The discussion mentions
  over 450 languages and dialects from NEA and beyond and gives about 900 glossed
  examples. The aim is to achieve both a cross-linguistically plausible typology and
  a maximal resolution of the linguistic diversity of Northeast Asia.
