blurb: "The Alor-Pantar family constitutes the westernmost outlier group of Papuan\
  \ (Non-Austronesian) languages. Its twenty or so languages are spoken on the islands\
  \ of Alor and Pantar, located just north of Timor, in eastern Indonesia. Together\
  \ with the Papuan languages of Timor, they make up the Timor-Alor-Pantar family.\
  \ The languages average 5,000 speakers and are<br>under pressure from the local\
  \ Malay variety as well as the national language, Indonesian.\r\n<br>This volume\
  \ studies the internal and external linguistic history of this<br>interesting group,\
  \ and showcases some of its unique typological features, such as the preference\
  \ to index the transitive patient-like argument on the verb but not the agent-like\
  \ one; the extreme variety in morphological alignment patterns; the use of plural\
  \ number words; the existence of quinary numeral systems; the elaborate spatial\
  \ deictic systems involving an elevation component; and the great variation exhibited\
  \ in their kinship systems.\r\n<br>Unlike many other Papuan languages, Alor-Pantar\
  \ languages do not exhibit clause-chaining, do not have switch reference systems,\
  \ never suffix subject indexes to verbs, do not mark gender, but do encode clusivity\
  \ in their pronominal systems. Indeed, apart from a broadly similar head-final syntactic\
  \ profile, there is little else that the Alor-Pantar languages share with Papuan\
  \ languages spoken in other regions. While all of them show some traces of contact\
  \ with Austronesian languages, in general, borrowing from Austronesian has not been\
  \ intense, and contact with Malay and Indonesian is a relatively recent phenomenon\
  \ in most of the Alor-Pantar region.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis is the second edition of\
  \ the volume that was originally published in 2014, as one of the first open access\
  \ publications of Language Science Press. In less than three years, the first edition\
  \ had more than 10,000 downloads, many of which in Indonesia, and downloads are\
  \ still increasing. To us this demonstrates how important it is to use use free\
  \ open access to enable both scientists and speakers of local languages in Indonesia\
  \ to read this work. <br><br>In this second edition, typographical errors have been\
  \ corrected, some small textual improvements have been implemented, broken URL links\
  \ repaired or removed, and maps and references updated. The overall content of the\
  \ chapters has not been changed."
