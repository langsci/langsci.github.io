blurb: "\"Form\" and \"formalism\" are a pair of highly productive and polysemous\
  \ terms that occupy a central place in much linguistic scholarship. Diverse notions\
  \ of \"form\"&nbsp; \x96 embedded in biological, cognitive and aesthetic discourses\
  \ \x96 have been employed in accounts of language structure and relationship, while\
  \ \"formalism\" harbours a family of senses referring to particular approaches to\
  \ the study of language as well as representations of linguistic phenomena. This\
  \ volume brings together a series of contributions from historians of science and\
  \ philosophers of language that explore some of the key meanings and uses that these\
  \ multifaceted terms and their derivatives have found in linguistics, and what these\
  \ reveal about the mindset, temperament and daily practice of linguists, from the\
  \ nineteenth century up to the present day."
