blurb: "Research in linguistics, as in most other scientific domains, is usually approached\
  \ in a modular way \x96 narrowing the domain of inquiry in order to allow for increased\
  \ depth of study. This is necessary and productive for a topic as wide-ranging and\
  \ complex as human language. However, precisely because language is a complex system,\
  \ tied to perception, learning, memory, and social organization, the assumption\
  \ of modularity can also be an obstacle to understanding language at a deeper level.\
  \ This book examines the consequences of enforcing non-modularity along two dimensions:\
  \ the temporal, and the cognitive. Along the temporal dimension, synchronic and\
  \ diachronic domains are linked by the requirement that sound changes must lead\
  \ to viable, stable language states. Along the cognitive dimension, sound change\
  \ and variation are linked to speech perception and production by requiring non-trivial\
  \ transformations between acoustic and articulatory representations.\r\nThe methodological\
  \ focus of this work is on computational modeling. By formalising and implementing\
  \ theoretical accounts, modeling can expose theoretical gaps and covert assumptions.\
  \ To do so, it is necessary to formally assess the functional equivalence of specific\
  \ implementational choices, as well as their mapping to theoretical structures.\
  \ This book applies this analytic approach to a series of implemented models of\
  \ sound change. As theoretical inconsistencies are discovered, possible solutions\
  \ are proposed, incrementally constructing a set of sufficient properties for a\
  \ working model. Because internal theoretical consistency is enforced, this model\
  \ corresponds to an explanatorily adequate theory. And because explicit links between\
  \ modules are required, this is a theory, not only of sound change, but of many\
  \ aspects of phonological competence.\r\nThe book highlights two aspects of modeling\
  \ work that receive relatively little attention: the formal mapping from model to\
  \ theory, and the scalability of demonstration models. Focusing on these aspects\
  \ of modeling makes it clear that any theory of sound change in the specific is\
  \ impossible without a more general theory of language: of the relationship between\
  \ perception and production, the relationship between phonetics and phonology, the\
  \ learning of linguistic units, and the nature of underlying representations. Theories\
  \ of sound change that do not explicitly address these aspects of language are making\
  \ tacit, untested assumptions about their properties. Addressing so many aspects\
  \ of language may seem to complicate the linguist's task. However, as this book\
  \ shows, it actually helps impose boundary conditions of ecological validity that\
  \ reduce the theoretical search space."
