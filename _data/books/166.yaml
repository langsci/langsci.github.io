blurb: "This&nbsp;book presents evidence in support of the hypothesis that Ship English\
  \ of the early Atlantic colonial period was a distinct variety with characteristic\
  \ features. It is motivated by the recognition that late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth\
  \ century sailors\x92 speech was potentially an influential variety in nascent creoles\
  \ and English varieties of the Caribbean, yet few academic studies have attempted\
  \ to define the characteristics of this speech. Therefore, the two principal aims\
  \ of this study were, firstly, to outline the socio-demographics of the maritime\
  \ communities and examine how variant linguistic features may have developed and\
  \ spread among these communities, and, secondly, to generate baseline data on the\
  \ characteristic features of Ship English. The methodology\x92s data collection\
  \ strategy targeted written representations of sailors\x92 speech prepared or published\
  \ between the dates 1620 and 1750, and prioritized documents that were composed\
  \ by working mariners. These written representations were then analyzed following\
  \ a mixed methods triangulation design that converged the qualitative and quantitative\
  \ data to determine plausible interpretations of the most likely spoken forms. Findings\
  \ substantiate claims that there was a distinct dialect of English that was spoken\
  \ by sailors during the period of early English colonial expansion. They also suggest\
  \ that Ship English was a sociolect formed through the mixing, leveling and simplification\
  \ processes of koinization. Indicators suggest that this occupation-specific variety\
  \ stabilized and spread in maritime communities through predominantly oral speech\
  \ practices and strong affiliations among groups of sailors. It was also transferred\
  \ to port communities and sailors\x92 home regions through regular contact between\
  \ sailors speaking this sociolect and the land-based service-providers and communities\
  \ that maintained and supplied the fleets. Linguistic data show that morphological\
  \ characteristics of Ship English are evident at the word-level, and syntactic characteristics\
  \ are evident not only in phrase construction but also at the larger clause and\
  \ sentence levels, whilst discourse is marked by characteristic patterns of subordination\
  \ and culture-specific interjection patterns. The newly-identified characteristics\
  \ of Ship English detailed&nbsp;here provide baseline data that may now serve as\
  \ an entry point for scholars to integrate this language variety into the discourse\
  \ on dialect variation in Early Modern English period and the theories on pidgin\
  \ and creole genesis as a result of language contact in the early colonial period.\r\
  \n<div>\r\n<blockquote><em>In this thoroughly researched and brilliantly written\
  \ volume, Sally Delgado opens up vitally important new avenues for the study of\
  \ the role of marginalized peoples such as sailors and convicts in the emergence\
  \ of creole languages and other contact varieties of the colonial era. Since the\
  \ ground-breaking work of Ian Hancock some decades ago, we have been waiting for\
  \ a coherent and comprehensive work such as this to establish a framework and data\
  \ base for making the systematic investigation of Ship English a reality.</em> (Nicholas\
  \ Faraclas, University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus)</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\
  \n<div>\r\n<blockquote><em>The historiography of creole languages has long included\
  \ frequent references to maritime English with only sketchy indication of just what\
  \ this kind of speech was like. Sally Delgado has at last provided a comprehensive\
  \ survey of a dialect that emerged on shipboard among sailors, which became one\
  \ element in the new Englishes that emerged worldwide amidst the transatlantic slave\
  \ trade and beyond. Anyone interested in creole languages, as well as those who\
  \ would like their acquaintance with sailors' speech in the past to get beyond the\
  \ likes of \"Aye, matey\", should consult this new volume.</em> (John H McWhorter,\
  \ Columbia University)</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<blockquote><em>While\
  \ classes on \x93World English\x94 are increasingly being included in university\
  \ curricula, they provide little on how that language left the shores of Britain\
  \ in the first place, and what it was like; until now, research in dialect studies\
  \ on what was spoken on board ship during the early colonial period has been minimal.\
  \ Dr. Delgado\x92s book is the first full-length study to address this; in addition\
  \ to examining the distinctive characteristics of Ship English as an occupational\
  \ register, it proposes that as the earliest contact variety, it provided the input\
  \ in the formation of the Atlantic English-lexifier creoles. A groundbreaking study,\
  \ essential reading for dialectologist and creolist alike.</em> (Ian Hancock, The\
  \ University of Texas)</blockquote>\r\n</div>"
