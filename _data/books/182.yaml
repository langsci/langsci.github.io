blurb: "The purpose of this volume is to present a snapshot of the state of the art\
  \ of research on the languages of the Maltese islands, which include spoken Maltese,\
  \ Maltese English and Maltese Sign Language.\r\nMalta is a tiny, but densely populated\
  \ country, with over 422,000 inhabitants spread over only 316 square kilometers.\
  \ It is a bilingual country, with Maltese and English enjoying the status of official\
  \ languages. Maltese is a descendant of Arabic, but due to the history of the island,\
  \ it has borrowed extensively from Sicilian, Italian and English. Furthermore, local\
  \ dialects still coexist alongside the official standard language. The status of\
  \ English as a second language dates back to British colonial rule, and just as\
  \ in other former British colonies, a characteristic Maltese variety of English\
  \ has developed. To these languages must be added Maltese Sign Language, which is\
  \ the language of the Maltese Deaf community. This was recently recognised as Malta\x92\
  s third official language by an act of Parliament in 2016.\r\nWhile a volume such\
  \ as the present one can hardly do justice to all aspects of a diverse and complex\
  \ linguistic situation, even in a small community like that of Malta, our aim in\
  \ editing this book was to shed light on the main strands of research being undertaken\
  \ in the Maltese linguistic context.\r\nSix of the contributions in this book focus\
  \ on Maltese and explore a broad range of topics including: historical changes in\
  \ the Maltese sound system; syllabification strategies; the interaction of prosody\
  \ and gesture; the constraints regulating /t/-insertion; the productivity of derivational\
  \ suffixes; and raising phenomena. The study of Maltese English, especially with\
  \ the purpose of establishing the defining characteristics of this variety of English,\
  \ is a relatively new area of research. Three of the papers in this volume deal\
  \ with Maltese English, which is explored from the different perspectives of rhythm,\
  \ the syntax of nominal phrases, and lexical choice. The last contribution discusses\
  \ the way in which Maltese Sign Language (LSM) has evolved alongside developments\
  \ in LSM research.\r\nIn summary, we believe the present volume has the potential\
  \ to present a unique snapshot of a complex linguistic situation in a geographically\
  \ restricted area. Given the nature and range of topics proposed, the volume will\
  \ likely be of interest to researchers in both theoretical and comparative linguistics,\
  \ as well as those working with experimental and corpus-based methodologies. Our\
  \ hope is that the studies presented here will also serve to pave the way for further\
  \ research on the languages of Malta, encouraging researchers to also take new directions,\
  \ including the exploration of variation and sociolinguistic factors which, while\
  \ often raised as explanatory constructs in the papers presented here, remain under-researched."
