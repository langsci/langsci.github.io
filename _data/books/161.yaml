blurb: "The identification and classification of nominal predicators and their arguments\
  \ is a notorious problem in natural language processing (NLP). Semantic reasoning,\
  \ information retrieval, question answering and other applications can benefit greatly\
  \ from a successful treatment of nominal predication. Overall, a considerable amount\
  \ of work in NLP focuses on the identification and annotation of verbal predication\
  \ and arguments thereof, and there is less research on types and identification\
  \ of nominal predicates and their arguments. This book is a contribution of the\
  \ latter type. It focuses on the description and analysis of nominal arguments in\
  \ the South Asian language Hindi/Urdu. The analysis is couched within the theory\
  \ of Lexical-Functional Grammar and is implemented in a computational grammar, the\
  \ Urdu ParGram grammar, which is a part of the ParGram (\x93Parallel Grammar\x94\
  ) project on parallel LFG grammar engineering. The implementation makes use of the\
  \ grammar development platform XLE.\r\n&nbsp;"
