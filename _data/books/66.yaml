blurb: "\nThis grammar provides the first comprehensive grammatical description of\
  \ Yakkha, a Sino-Tibetan language of the Kiranti branch. Yakkha is spoken by about\n\
  14,000 speakers in eastern Nepal, in the Sankhuwa Sabha and Dhankuta districts.\n\
  The grammar is based on original fieldwork in the Yakkha community. Its primary\
  \ source of data is a corpus of 13,000 clauses from narratives and naturally-occurring\
  \ social interaction which the author recorded and transcribed between\n2009 and\
  \ 2012. Corpus analyses were complemented by targeted elicitation.  \nThe grammar\
  \ is written in a functional-typological framework. It focusses on\nmorphosyntactic\
  \ and semantic issues, as these present highly complex and comparatively under-researched\
  \ fields in Kiranti languages. The sequence of the chapters follows the well-established\
  \ order of phonological, morphological, syntactic and discourse-structural descriptions.\
  \ These are supplemented by a historical\nand sociolinguistic introduction as well\
  \ as an analysis of the complex kinship\nterminology. Topics such as verbal person\
  \ marking, argument structure, transitivity, complex predication, grammatical relations,\
  \ clause linkage, nominalization, and the topography-based orientation system have\
  \ received in-depth treatment. Wherever possible, the structures found were explained\
  \ in a historical-comparative perspective in order to shed more light on how their\
  \ particular properties have emerged.\n"
