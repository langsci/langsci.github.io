blurb: "Fascinated with the heritage of ancient Greece, early modern intellectuals\
  \ cultivated a deep interest in its language, the primary gateway to this long-lost\
  \ culture, rehabilitated during the Renaissance. Inspired by the humanist battle\
  \ cry \x93To the sources!\x94 scholars took a detailed look at the Greek source\
  \ texts in the original language and its different dialects. In so doing, they saw\
  \ themselves confronted with major linguistic questions: Is there any order in this\
  \ immense diversity? Can the Ancient Greek dialects be classified into larger groups?\
  \ Is there a hierarchy among the dialects? Which dialect is the oldest? Where should\
  \ problematic varieties such as Homeric and Biblical Greek be placed? How are the\
  \ differences between the Greek dialects to be described, charted, and explained?\
  \ What is the connection between the diversity of the Greek tongue and the Greek\
  \ homeland? And, last but not least, are Greek dialects similar to the dialects\
  \ of the vernacular tongues? Why (not)? This book discusses and analyzes the often\
  \ surprising and sometimes contradictory early modern answers to these questions."
