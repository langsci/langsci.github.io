blurb: "Komnzo is a Papuan language of Southern New Guinea spoken by around 250 people\
  \ in the village of Rouku. Komnzo belongs to the Tonda subgroup of the Yam language\
  \ family, which is also known as the Morehead Upper-Maro group. This grammar provides\
  \ the first comprehensive description of a Yam language. It is based on 16 months\
  \ of fieldwork. The primary source of data is a text corpus of around 12 hours recorded\
  \ and transcribed between 2010 and 2015. Komnzo provides many fields of future research,\
  \ but the most interesting aspect of its structure lies in the verb morphology,\
  \ to which the two largest chapters of the grammar are dedicated. Komnzo verbs may\
  \ index up to two arguments showing agreement in person, number and gender. Verbs\
  \ encode 18 TAM categories, valency, directionality and deictic status. Morphological\
  \ complexity lies not only in the amount of categories that verbs may express, but\
  \ also in the way these are encoded. Komnzo verbs exhibit what may be called \x91\
  distributed exponence\x92, i.e. single morphemes are underspecified for a particular\
  \ grammatical category. Therefore, morphological material from different sites has\
  \ to be integrated first, and only after this integration can one arrive at a particular\
  \ grammatical category. The descriptive approach in this grammar is theory-informed\
  \ rather than theory-driven. Comparison to other Yam languages and diachronic developments\
  \ are taken into account whenever it seems helpful."
