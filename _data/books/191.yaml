blurb: This book proposes the reconstruction of the Proto-Niger-Congo numeral system.
  The emphasis is placed on providing an exhaustive account of the distribution of
  forms by families, groups, and branches. The big data bases used for this purpose
  open prospects for both working with the distribution of words that do exist and
  with the distribution of gaps in postulated cognates.&nbsp; The distribution of
  filled cells and gaps is a useful tool for reconstruction.<br><br>Following an introduction
  in the first chapter, the second chapter of this book is devoted to the study of
  various uses of noun class markers in numeral terms. <br>The third chapter deals
  with the alignment by analogy in numeral systems. <br>Chapter 4 offers a step-by-step
  reconstruction of number systems of the proto-languages underlying each of the twelve
  major NC families, on the basis of the step-by-step-reconstruction of numerals within
  each family. <br>Chapter 5 deals with the reconstruction of the Proto-Niger-Congo
  numeral system on the basis of the step-by-step-reconstructions offered in Chapter
  4. <br>Chapter 6 traces the history of the numerals of Proto-Niger-Congo, reconstructed
  in Chapter 5, in each individual family of languages.
