blurb: "Empirically, the book covers two areas: the morphosyntax of verbs and categories\
  \ syncretic with the declarative complementizer in Slavic, together with a comparative\
  \ look at the similar categories in Latvian (Baltic) and Basa\xE1 (Bantu). In the\
  \ domain of verbs, the book investigates a curious instance of analytic vs. fusional\
  \ realization of grammatical categories that we find in a semelfactive-iterative\
  \ alternation in Czech and Polish, where a semelfactive verb stem such as in the\
  \ Czech <em>kop-n-ou-t</em> \x91give a kick\x92 alternates with an iterative verb\
  \ stem as in <em>kop-a-t</em> \x91kick repeatedly\x92. The iterative <em>-aj</em>\
  \ stem is morphologi cally less complex than the semelfactive stem formed with the\
  \ <em>-n-ou</em> sequence, which is paradoxical given an analysis of iteratives\
  \ as categories whose syn-sem representation is more complex than semelfactives.\
  \ In the domain of complementizers, the book focuses on cross-categorial paradigms\
  \ that include an unexpected morphological containment (in Russian), a degree of\
  \ morphological complexity (in Latvian), and an ABA pattern of syncretic alignment\
  \ (in Basa\xE1), which we do not expect to find if syncretism is restricted to adjacent\
  \ cells in a paradigm (cf. Bobaljik 2012).\r\nAnalytically, the book focuses on\
  \ the way the syntactic representations of these categories become realized as morphemes.\
  \ In the general sense, then, this contribution belongs to a growing body of work\
  \ that investigates the relation between syntactic structure and morphological form,\
  \ understood as the amount of morphemes and their placement \x96 in particular the\
  \ prefix vs. suffix opposition. More specifically, however, the approach to lexicalization\
  \ taken up in this book is informed by the results of research on syntax in the\
  \ last quarter of a century, which show that syntactic representations are maximally\
  \ fine-grained, the picture sometimes described as the \x93one feature per one syntactic\
  \ head\x94 dictum. Such a scenario has lead to the situation where syntactic representations\
  \ can be submorphemic, in the sense that a lexical item corresponds to more than\
  \ one syntactic head, a strand of research that has become known as Nanosyntax.\
  \ This book investigates the state-of-art methodology of Nanosyntax in resolving\
  \ the selected empirical problems in the domain of Slavic verbs and declarative\
  \ complementizers, the problems that all appear to boil down to the way syntactic\
  \ representations become realized as morphemes."
