blurb: Pite Saami is a highly endangered Western Saami language in the Uralic language
  family currently spoken by a few individuals in Swedish Lapland. This grammar is
  the first extensive book-length treatment of a Saami language written in English.
  While focussing on the morphophonology of the main word classes nouns, adjectives
  and verbs, it also deals with other linguistic structures such as prosody, phonology,
  phrase types and clauses. Furthermore, it provides an introduction to the language
  and its speakers, and an outline of a preliminary Pite Saami orthography. An extensive
  annotated spoken-language corpus collected over the course of five years forms the
  empirical foundation for this description, and each example includes a specific
  reference to the corpus in order to facilitate verification of claims made on the
  data. Descriptions are presented for a general linguistics audience and without
  attempting to support a specific theoretical approach, but this book should be equally
  useful for scholars of Uralic linguistics, typologists, and even learners of Pite
  Saami.
