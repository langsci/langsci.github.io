blurb: <em class="">Advances in Formal Slavic Linguistics 2016</em>&nbsp;initiates
  a new series of collective volumes on formal Slavic linguistics. It presents a selection
  of high quality papers authored by young and senior linguists from around the world
  and contains both empirically oriented work, underpinned by up-to-date experimental
  methods, as well as more theoretically grounded contributions. The volume covers
  all major linguistic areas, including morphosyntax, semantics, pragmatics, phonology,
  and their mutual interfaces. The particular topics discussed include argument structure,
  word order, case, agreement, tense, aspect, clausal left periphery, or segmental
  phonology. The topical breadth and analytical depth of the contributions reflect
  the vitality of the field of formal Slavic linguistics and prove its relevance to
  the global linguistic endeavour. Early versions of the papers included in this volume
  were presented at the conference on Formal Description of Slavic Languages 12 or
  at the satellite Workshop on Formal and Experimental Semantics and Pragmatics, which
  were held on December 7-10, 2016 in Berlin.
