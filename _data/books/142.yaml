blurb: <br>Biolinguistics provides a great example of the promises and the challenges
  of interdisciplinarity. As a field, it has its roots in the cognitive revolution
  and in particular in the early work of Lenneberg and Chomsky, which focused on "language"
  as part of our biological endownment. But this book argues that biolinguistics can
  and should be much more than just pointing towards biology. The past decades have
  seen methodological innovations and interdisciplinary rapprochements that make it
  possible to be more concrete about the "bio" part. Drawing on a wide range of cross-disciplinary
  work, Cedric Boeckx argues there has never been a better time to do biolinguistics.
