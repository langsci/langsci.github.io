blurb: "The Siouan family comprises some twenty languages, historically spoken across\
  \ a broad swath of the central North American plains and woodlands, as well as in\
  \ parts of the southeastern United States. In spite of its geographical extent and\
  \ diversity, and the size and importance of several Siouan-speaking tribes, this\
  \ family has received relatively little attention in the linguistic literature and\
  \ many of the individual Siouan languages are severely understudied. This volume\
  \ aims to make work on Siouan languages more broadly available and to encourage\
  \ deeper investigation of the myriad typological, theoretical, descriptive, and\
  \ pedagogical issues they raise.\r\nThe 17 chapters in this volume present a broad\
  \ range of current Siouan research, focusing on various Siouan languages, from a\
  \ variety of linguistic perspectives: historical-genetic, philological, applied,\
  \ descriptive, formal/generative, and comparative/typological. The editors' preface\
  \ summarizes characteristic features of the Siouan family, including head-final\
  \ and \"verb-centered\" syntax, a complex system of verbal affixes including applicatives\
  \ and subject-possessives, head-internal relative clauses, gendered speech markers,\
  \ stop-systems including ejectives, and a preference for certain prosodic and phonotactic\
  \ patterns.\r\nThe volume is dedicated to the memory of Professor Robert L. Rankin,\
  \ a towering figure in Siouan linguistics throughout his long career, who passed\
  \ away in February of 2014."
