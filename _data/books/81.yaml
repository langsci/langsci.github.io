blurb: "Traditional dialects have been encroached upon by the increasing mobility\
  \ of their speakers and by the onslaught of national languages in education and\
  \ mass media. Typically, older dialects are \x93leveling\x94 to become more like\
  \ national languages. This is regrettable when the last articulate traces of a culture\
  \ are lost, but it also promotes a complex dynamics of interaction as speakers shift\
  \ from dialect to standard and to intermediate compromises between the two in their\
  \ forms of speech. Varieties of speech thus live on in modern communities, where\
  \ they still function to mark provenance, but increasingly cultural and social provenance\
  \ as opposed to pure geography. They arise at times from the need to function throughout\
  \ the different groups in society, but they also may have roots in immigrants\x92\
  \ speech, and just as certainly from the ineluctable dynamics of groups wishing\
  \ to express their identity to themselves and to the world.\r\n<em>The future of\
  \ dialects</em>&nbsp;is a selection of the papers presented at Methods in Dialectology\
  \ XV, held in Groningen, the Netherlands, 11-15 August 2014. While the focus is\
  \ on methodology, the volume also includes specialized studies on varieties of Catalan,\
  \ Breton, Croatian, (Belgian) Dutch, English (in the US, the UK and in Japan), German\
  \ (including Swiss German), Italian (including Tyrolean Italian), Japanese, and\
  \ Spanish as well as on heritage languages in Canada."
