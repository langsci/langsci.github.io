blurb: <p align="justify"><em>Advances in Formal Slavic Linguistics 2017</em> is a
  collection of fifteen articles that were prepared on the basis of talks given at
  the conference Formal Description of Slavic Languages 12.5, which was held on December
  7-9, 2017, at the University of Nova Gorica. The volume covers a wide array of topics,
  such as control verbs, instrumental arguments, and perduratives in Russian, comparatives,
  negation, n-words, negative polarity items, and complementizer ellipsis in Czech,
  impersonal se-constructions and complementizer doubling in Slovenian, prosody and
  the morphology of multi-purpose suffixes in Serbo-Croatian, and indefinite numerals
  and the binding properties of dative arguments in Polish. Importantly, by exploring
  these phenomena in individual Slavic languages, the collection of articles in this
  volume makes a significant contribution to both Slavic linguistics and to linguistics
  in general.
