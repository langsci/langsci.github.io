blurb: 'This book provides a complete analysis of synchronic CV -&gt; VC metathesis
  in Amarasi, a language of western Timor. Metathesis and unmetathesis realise a paradigm
  of parallel forms, pairs of which occur to complement each other throughout the
  language.<br><br>Metathesis in Amarasi is superficially associated with a bewildering
  array of disparate phonological processes including: vowel deletion, consonant deletion,
  consonant insertion and multiple kinds of vowel assimilation, any of which can (and
  do) vary by lect in their realisation. By proposing that Amarasi has an obligatory
  CVCVC foot in which C-slots can be empty, all these phonological processes can be
  straightforwardly derived from a single rule of metathesis and two associated phonological
  rules. <br><br>Three kinds of metathesis can be identified in Amarasi: (i) Before
  vowel initial enclitics, roots must undergo metathesis, responding to the need to
  create a phonological boundary between a clitic host and enclitic. Such metathesis
  is phonologically conditioned. (ii) Metathesis occurs within the syntax to signal
  attributive modification. Such a metathesised form cannot occur at the end of a
  phrase and thus requires the presence of an unmetathesised form to complete it syntactically.
  (iii) In the discourse an unmetathesised form marks an unresolved event or situation.
  Such an unmetathesised form cannot occur in isolation and requires a metathesised
  form to achieve resolution.<br><br>Metathesis in Amarasi is the central linguistic
  process around which linguistic structures are organised. Amarasi metatheses also
  reflect fundamental Timorese notions of societal and cosmic organisation. Alongside
  weaving and other performed activities, metathesis is an important linguistic marker
  of identity in a region obsessed with similarities and differences&nbsp; between
  different groups. The complementarity of Amarasi metathesis and unmetathesis within
  the syntax and within discourse reflects the Timorese division of the world into
  a series of mutually dependent binary and complementary pairs. As well as being
  the key which unlocks the structure of the language, metathesis is also a reflection
  of the structure of Amarasi society and culture.'
