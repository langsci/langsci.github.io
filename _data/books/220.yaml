blurb: "This volume provides an up-to-date discussion of a foundational issue that\
  \ has recently taken centre stage in linguistic typology and which is relevant to\
  \ the language sciences more generally: To what extent can cross-linguistic generalizations,\
  \ i.e. statistical universals of linguistic structure, be explained by the diachronic\
  \ sources of these structures? Everyone agrees that typological distributions are\
  \ the result of complex histories, as \x93languages evolve into the variation states\
  \ to which synchronic universals pertain\x94 (Hawkins 1988). However, an increasingly\
  \ popular line of argumentation holds that many, perhaps most, typological regularities\
  \ are long-term reflections of their diachronic sources, rather than being \x91\
  target-driven\x92 by overarching functional-adaptive motivations. On this view,\
  \ recurrent pathways of reanalysis and grammaticalization can lead to uniform synchronic\
  \ results, obviating the need to postulate global forces like ambiguity avoidance,\
  \ processing efficiency or iconicity, especially if there is no evidence for such\
  \ motivations in the genesis of the respective constructions. On the other hand,\
  \ the recent typological literature is equally ripe with talk of \"complex adaptive\
  \ systems\", \"attractor states\" and \"cross-linguistic convergence\". One may\
  \ wonder, therefore, how much room is left for traditional functional-adaptive forces\
  \ and how exactly they influence the diachronic trajectories that shape universal\
  \ distributions. The papers in the present volume are intended to provide an accessible\
  \ introduction to this debate. Covering theoretical, methodological and empirical\
  \ facets of the issue at hand, they represent current ways of thinking about the\
  \ role of diachronic sources in explaining grammatical universals, articulated by\
  \ seasoned and budding linguists alike."
