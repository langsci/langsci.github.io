blurb: "This grammar provides a grammatical description of Palula, an Indo-Aryan language\
  \ of the Shina group. The language is spoken by about 10,000 people in the Chitral\
  \ district in Pakistan\x92s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. This is the first extensive\
  \ description of the formerly little-documented Palula language, and is one of only\
  \ a few in-depth studies available for languages in the extremely multilingual Hindukush-Karakoram\
  \ region. \nThe grammar is based on original fieldwork data, collected over the\
  \ course of about ten years, commencing in 1998. It is primarily in the form of\
  \ recorded, mainly narrative, texts, but supplemented by targeted elicitation as\
  \ well as notes of observed language use. All fieldwork was conducted in close collaboration\
  \ with the Palula-speaking community, and a number of native speakers took active\
  \ part in the process of data gathering, annotation and data management. \nThe main\
  \ areas covered are phonology, morphology and syntax, illustrated with a large number\
  \ of example items and utterances, but also a few selected lexical topics of some\
  \ prominence have received a more detailed treatment as part of the morphosyntactic\
  \ structure. Suggestions for further research that should be undertaken are given\
  \ throughout the grammar.\nThe approach is theory-informed rather than theory-driven,\
  \ but an underlying functional-typological framework is assumed. Diachronic development\
  \ is taken into account, particularly in the area of morphology, and comparisons\
  \ with other languages and references to areal phenomena are included insofar as\
  \ they are motivated and available. The description also provides a brief introduction\
  \ to the speaker community and their immediate environment."
