blurb: This volume seeks to infer large phylogenetic networks from phonetically encoded
  lexical data and contribute in this way to the historical study of language varieties.
  The technical step that enables progress in this case is the use of causal inference
  algorithms. Sample sets of words from language varieties are preprocessed into automatically
  inferred cognate sets, and then modeled as information-theoretic variables based
  on an intuitive measure of cognate overlap. Causal inference is then applied to
  these variables in order to determine the existence and direction of influence among
  the varieties. The directed arcs in the resulting graph structures can be interpreted
  as reflecting the existence and directionality of lexical flow, a unified model
  which subsumes inheritance and borrowing as the two main ways of transmission that
  shape the basic lexicon of languages. A flow-based separation criterion and domain-specific
  directionality detection criteria are developed to make existing causal inference
  algorithms more robust against imperfect cognacy data, giving rise to two new algorithms.
  The Phylogenetic Lexical Flow Inference (PLFI) algorithm requires lexical features
  of proto-languages to be reconstructed in advance, but yields fully general phylogenetic
  networks, whereas the more complex Contact Lexical Flow Inference (CLFI) algorithm
  treats proto-languages as hidden common causes, and only returns hypotheses of historical
  contact situations between attested languages. The algorithms are evaluated both
  against a large lexical database of Northern Eurasia spanning many language families,
  and against simulated data generated by a new model of language contact that builds
  on the opening and closing of directional contact channels as primary evolutionary
  events. The algorithms are found to infer the existence of contacts very reliably,
  whereas the inference of directionality remains difficult. This currently limits
  the new algorithms to a role as exploratory tools for quickly detecting salient
  patterns in large lexical datasets, but it should soon be possible for the framework
  to be enhanced e.g. by confidence values for each directionality decision.
