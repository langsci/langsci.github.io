blurb: This book provides a new analysis for the syntax of comparatives, focusing
  on various deletion phenomena affecting the subclause. In particular, the proposed
  account shows that Comparative Deletion is merely a surface phenomenon that can
  be drawn back to the overtness of the comparative operator and the availability
  of lower copies of a movement chain, and it is thus subject to both language-internal
  and cross-linguistic variation. The main focus of the book is on English, yet other
  languages are also discussed for comparative purposes, with the aim of showing what
  the idiosyncratic properties of English comparatives are.

      linguistics in 2014 at the University of Potsdam, where she later also carried
      out a research project on the syntax of functional left peripheries as principal
      investigator. Her research focuses on clause typing and the syntactic properties
      of the CP-domain in various finite subordinate clauses, including degree clauses
      such as canonical comparative constructions. Her work is mainly devoted to the
      study of West-Germanic languages, but her cross-linguistic investigations include
      many other languages.</p>']
