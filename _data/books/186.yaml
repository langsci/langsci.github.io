blurb: "The organization of the lexicon, and especially the relations between groups\
  \ of lexemes is a strongly debated topic in linguistics. Some authors have insisted\
  \ on the lack of any structure of the lexicon. In this vein, Di Sciullo &amp; Williams\
  \ (1987: 3) claim that \x93[t]he lexicon is like a prison \x96 it contains only\
  \ the lawless, and the only thing that its inmates have in commonis lawlessness\x94\
  . In the alternative view, the lexicon is assumed to have a rich structure that\
  \ captures all regularities and partial regularities that exist between lexical\
  \ entries.Two very different schools of linguistics have insisted on the organization\
  \ of the lexicon.\r\nOn the one hand, for theories like HPSG (Pollard &amp; Sag\
  \ 1994), but also some versions of construction grammar (Fillmore &amp; Kay 1995),\
  \ the lexicon is assumed to have a very rich structure which captures common grammatical\
  \ properties between its members. In this approach, a type hierarchy organizes the\
  \ lexicon according to common properties between items. For example, Koenig (1999:\
  \ 4, among others), working from an HPSG perspective, claims that the lexicon \x93\
  provides a unified model for partial regularties, medium-size generalizations, and\
  \ truly productive processes\x94. <br> <br>On the other hand, from the perspective\
  \ of usage-based linguistics, several authors have drawn attention to the fact that\
  \ lexemes which share morphological or syntactic properties, tend to be organized\
  \ in clusters of surface (phonological or semantic) similarity (Bybee &amp; Slobin\
  \ 1982; Skousen 1989; Eddington 1996). This approach, often called analogical, has\
  \ developed highly accurate computational and non-computational models that can\
  \ predict the classes to which lexemes belong. Like the organization of lexemes\
  \ in type hierarchies, analogical relations between items help speakers to make\
  \ sense of intricate systems, and reduce apparent complexity (K\xF6pcke &amp; Zubin\
  \ 1984). <br> <br>Despite this core commonality, and despite the fact that most\
  \ linguists seem to agree that analogy plays an important role in language, there\
  \ has been remarkably little work on bringing together these two approaches. Formal\
  \ grammar traditions have been very successful in capturing grammatical behaviour,\
  \ but, in the process, have downplayed the role analogy plays in linguistics (Anderson\
  \ 2015). In this work, I aim to change this state of affairs. First, by providing\
  \ an explicit formalization of how analogy interacts with grammar, and second, by\
  \ showing that analogical effects and relations closely mirror the structures in\
  \ the lexicon. I <br>will show that both formal grammar approaches, and usage-based\
  \ analogical models, capture mutually compatible relations in the lexicon."
