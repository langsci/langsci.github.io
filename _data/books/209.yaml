blurb: Unlike other professions, the impact of information and communication technology
  on interpreting has been moderate so far. However, recent advances in the areas
  of remote, computer-assisted, and, most recently, machine interpreting, are gaining
  the interest of both researchers and practitioners. This volume aims at exploring
  key issues, approaches and challenges to the interplay of interpreting and technology,
  an area that is still underrepresented in the field of Interpreting Studies. The
  contributions to this volume cover topics in the area of computer-assisted and remote
  interpreting, both in the conference as well as in the court setting, and report
  on experimental studies.
