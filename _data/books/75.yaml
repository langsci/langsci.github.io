blurb: "Speakers use a variety of different linguistic resources in the construction\
  \ of their identities, and they are able to do so because their mental representations\
  \ of linguistic and social information are linked.  While the exact nature of these\
  \ representations remains unclear, there is growing evidence that they encode a\
  \ great deal more phonetic detail than traditionally assumed and that the phonetic\
  \ detail is linked with word-based information.  This book investigates the ways\
  \ in which a lemma\x92s phonetic realisation depends on a combination of its grammatical\
  \ function and the speaker\x92s social group.  This question is investigated within\
  \ the context of the word <i>like</i> as it is produced and perceived by students\
  \ at an all girls\x92 high school in New Zealand.  The results are used to inform\
  \ an exemplar-based model of speech production and perception in which the quality\
  \ and frequency of linguistic and non-linguistic variants contribute to a speaker\x92\
  s style."
