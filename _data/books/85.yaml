blurb: Pichi is an Afro-Caribbean English-lexifier Creole spoken on the island of
  Bioko, Equatorial Guinea. It is an offshoot of 19th century Krio (Sierra Leone)
  and shares many characteristics with West African relatives like Nigerian Pidgin,
  Cameroon Pidgin, and Ghanaian Pidgin English, as well as with the English-lexifier
  creoles of the insular and continental Caribbean. This comprehensive description
  presents a detailed analysis of the grammar and phonology of Pichi. It also includes
  a collection of texts and wordlists. Pichi features a nominative-accusative alignment,
  SVO word order, adjective-noun order, prenominal determiners, and prepositions.
  The language has a seven-vowel system and twenty-two consonant phonemes. Pichi has
  a two-tone system with tonal minimal pairs, morphological tone, and tonal processes.
  The morphological structure is largely isolating. Pichi has a rich system of tense-aspect-mood
  marking, an indicative-subjunctive opposition, and a complex copular system with
  several suppletive forms. Many features align Pichi with the Atlantic-Congo languages
  spoken in the West African littoral zone. At the same time, characteristics like
  the prenominal position of adjectives and determiners show a typological overlap
  with its lexifier English, while extensive contact with Spanish has left an imprint
  on the lexicon and grammar as well.
