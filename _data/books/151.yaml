blurb: "<em>On Looking into Words</em> is a wide-ranging volume spanning current research\
  \ into word structure and morphology, with a focus on historical linguistics and\
  \ linguistic theory. The papers are offered as a tribute to Stephen R. Anderson,\
  \ the Dorothy R. Diebold Professor of Linguistics at Yale, who is retiring at the\
  \ end of the 2016-2017 academic year. The contributors are friends, colleagues,\
  \ and former students of Professor Anderson, all important contributors to linguistics\
  \ in their own right. As is typical for such volumes, the contributions span a variety\
  \ of topics relating to the interests of the honorand. In this case, the central\
  \ contributions that Anderson has made to so many areas of linguistics and cognitive\
  \ science, drawing on synchronic and diachronic phenomena in diverse linguistic\
  \ systems, are represented through the papers in the volume. \r\nThe 26 papers that\
  \ constitute this volume are unified by their discussion of the interplay between\
  \ synchrony and diachrony, theory and empirical results, and the role of diachronic\
  \ evidence in understanding the nature of language. Central concerns of the volume\
  \ include morphological gaps, learnability, increases and declines in productivity,\
  \ and the interaction of different components of the grammar. The papers deal with\
  \ a range of linked synchronic and diachronic topics in phonology, morphology, and\
  \ syntax (in particular, cliticization), and their implications for linguistic theory."

  - [Claire, '', Bowern, "<p>Claire Bowern was promoted to Professor of Linguistics\
      \ in 2017. Following graduation from Harvard University, she spent four years\
      \ in Rice University\x92s Department of Linguistics before coming to Yale. Her\
      \ research focuses on the languages and history of Indigenous Australia. She\
      \ has been working with speakers of endangered, Indigenous languages since 1998,\
      \ both through fieldwork with the last speakers of several languages from Northern\
      \ Australia and through archival work with historical records, ranging from\
      \ the 1770s to the mid 1960s. Her work combines traditional methods of language\
      \ documentation and historical reconstruction with computational phylogenetics\
      \ and statistical approaches to language history. She is the author of two reference\
      \ grammars, two text books, and has edited or coedited several books on language\
      \ change, including the 2014 Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics (with\
      \ Bethwyn Evans). She is associate editor at Diachronica, past chair of the\
      \ Linguistic Society of America\x92s Ethics Committee, and a current LSA media\
      \ liaison. Her work is funded by the National Science Foundation.</p>"]
  - [Laurence, '', Horn, '<p>Laurence Horn, Professor Emeritus of Linguistics and
      Philosophy at Yale University, received his PhD at UCLA under the supervision
      of Barbara Partee. His 1972 dissertation, *On the Semantic Properties of Logical
      Operators in English,* introduced the notion of scalar implicature. He has taught
      at U.C. Berkeley, the University of Southern California, Aix-Marseille, and
      Wisconsin, and at linguistic institutes at Stanford, U.C. Santa Cruz, Illinois,
      Michigan State, and Ljubljana. He has been a plenary speaker at conferences
      in Belgium, China, Croatia, France, Germany, Great Britain, Israel, Japan, Korea,
      the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, Sweden, and the U.S. He is the
      author of *A Natural History of Negation* (Chicago, 1989/CSLI, 2001) and numerous
      papers and encyclopedia and handbook entries on negation, implicature, lexical
      semantics, logic, and pragmatic theory and is the editor of *Negation and Polarity*
      (with Yasuhiko Kato; Oxford, 2000), The Handbook of Pragmatics (with Gregory
      Ward; Blackwell, 2004),* Explorations in Pragmatics* (with Istvan Kecskes; de
      Gruyter, 2007), *The Expression of Negation* (de Gruyter, 2010), and *Micro-Syntactic
      Variation in North American English* (with Raffaella Zanuttini; Oxford, 2014).
      He is an active member of the American Dialect Society and the Linguistic Society
      of America and an elected Fellow of the LSA.</p>']
  - [Raffaella, '', Zanuttini, '<p>Raffaella Zanuttini received her PhD at the University
      of Pennsylvania in 1991 and is currently Professor of Linguistics at Yale. Her
      research focuses on comparative syntax. She has worked extensively on the range
      and limits of variation in the syntactic expression of negation. She has also
      investigated the notion of clause type at the syntax/semantics interface, focusing
      in particular on exclamatives and imperative clauses. Her interest in comparing
      minimally different languages has led her to found the Yale Grammatical Diversity
      Project &lt;http://ygdp.yale.edu&gt;, a research group whose goal is to document
      and analyse syntactic variation in North American English. Her publications
      include numerous articles and books, including *Negation and Clausal Structure:
      A Comparative Study of Romance Languages* (Oxford University Press, 1997), *An
      Annotated Syntax Reader: Lasting Insights and Questions* (with Richard Kay and
      Tom Leu; Wiley Blackwell, 2013), and *Micro-Syntactic Variation in North American
