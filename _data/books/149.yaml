blurb: "A new edition of this book is available at&nbsp; <a href=\"http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/234\"\
  >http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/234.</a>\r\nThis volume contains the complete\
  \ collection of published and unpublished work on German grammar by Tilman N. H\xF6\
  hle. It consists of two parts. The first part is <em>Topologische Felder</em>, a\
  \ book-length manuscript that was written in 1983 but was never finished nor published.\
  \ It is a careful examination of the topological properties of German sentences,\
  \ including a discussion of typological assumptions. The second part assembles all\
  \ other published and unpublished papers by H\xF6hle on German grammar.<br><br>All\
  \ of these papers were highly influential in German linguistics, in theoretical\
  \ linguistics in general, and in a specific variant of theoretical linguistics,\
  \ Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar. Topics covered are clause structure, constituent\
  \ order, coordination, (verum) focus, word structure, the relationship between relative\
  \ pronouns and verbs in V2, extraction, and the foundations of a theory of phonology\
  \ in constraint-based grammar.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAs per legal requirement, we state that\
  \ this book is available in Germany for 70 EUR."

      ttingen and the University of Cologne, where he also received his M.A. (1969)\
      \ and his PhD (1976). Having taught at the German Seminar of the University\
      \ of Cologne for many years, he changed to the University of T\xFCbingen in\
      \ 1984 where, besides teaching German linguistics, he was involved in training\
      \ several generations of general and computational linguists in grammatical\
      \ theory as well as theoretically oriented descriptive German grammar. He retired\
      \ in 2008.</p>\r\n<p>His research within grammatical theory and German grammar\
      \ covers (i) a range of syntactic topics, in particular topological and other\
      \ aspects of clause structure (such as extraction, non-finite constructions,\
      \ constituent order, coordination, (verum) focus), (ii) aspects of \x91word\
      \ syntax\x92, and (iii) theoretical aspects of phonology, in particular in model-theoretic\
      \ grammar (HPSG).</p>"]
