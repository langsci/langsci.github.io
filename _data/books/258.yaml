blurb: "This book offers a comprehensive account of dative structures across languages\
  \ \x96with an important, though not exclusive, focus on the Romance family. As is\
  \ well-known, datives play a central role in a variety of structures, ranging from\
  \ ditransitive constructions to cliticization of indirect objects and differentially\
  \ marked direct objects, and including also psychological predicates, possessor\
  \ or causative constructions, among many others. As interest in all these topics\
  \ has increased significantly over the past three decades, this volume provides\
  \ an overdue update on the state of the art. Accordingly, the chapters in this volume\
  \ account for both widely discussed patterns of dative constructions as well as\
  \ those that are relatively unknown."
