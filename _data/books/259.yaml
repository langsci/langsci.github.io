  \ Grammar (HPSG) is a constraint-based or declarative approach to linguistic knowledge,\
  \ which analyses all descriptive levels (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics,\
  \ pragmatics) with feature value pairs, structure sharing, and relational constraints.\
  \ In syntax it assumes that expressions have a single relatively simple constituent\
  \ structure. This volume provides a state-of-the-art introduction to the framework.\
  \ Various chapters discuss basic assumptions and formal foundations, describe the\
  \ evolution of the framework, and go into the details of the main syntactic phenomena.\
  \ Further chapters are devoted to non-syntactic levels of description. The book\
  \ also considers related fields and research areas (gesture, sign languages, computational\
  \ linguistics) and includes chapters comparing HPSG with other frameworks (Lexical\
  \ Functional Grammar, Categorial Grammar, Construction Grammar, Dependency Grammar,\
  \ and Minimalism). &nbsp;<br></span><span class=\"\" style=\"font-family: Calibri,Helvetica,sans-serif;\
