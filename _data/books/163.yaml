blurb: "Currently, there are two prominent schools in linguistics: Minimalism (Chomsky)\
  \ and Construction Grammar (Goldberg, Tomasello). Minimalism comes with the claim\
  \ that our linguistic capabilities consist of an abstract, binary combinatorial\
  \ operation (Merge) and a lexicon. Most versions of Construction Grammar assume\
  \ that language consists of flat phrasal schemata that contribute their own meaning\
  \ and may license additional arguments. This book examines a variant of Lexical\
  \ Functional Grammar, which is lexical in principle but was augmented by tools that\
  \ allow for the description of phrasal constructions in the Construction Grammar\
  \ sense. These new tools include templates that can be used to model inheritance\
  \ hierarchies and a resource driven semantics. The resource driven semantics makes\
  \ it possible to reach the effects that lexical rules had, for example remapping\
  \ of arguments, by semantic means. The semantic constraints can be evaluated in\
  \ the syntactic component, which is basically similar to the delayed execution of\
  \ lexical rules. So this is a new formalization that might be suitable to provide\
  \ solutions to longstanding problems that are not available for other formalizations.\r\
  \nWhile the authors suggest a lexical treatment of many phenomena and only assume\
  \ phrasal constructions for selected phenomena like benefactive and resultative\
  \ constructions in English, it can be shown that even these two constructions should\
  \ not be treated phrasally in English and that the analysis would not extend to\
  \ other languages as for instance German. I show that the new formal tools do not\
  \ really improve the situation and many of the basic conceptual problems remain.\
  \ Since this specific proposal fails for two constructions, it follows that proposals\
  \ (in the same framework) that assume phrasal analyses for all constructions are\
  \ not appropriate either.\r\nThe conclusion is that lexical models are needed and\
  \ this entails that the schemata that combine syntactic objects are rather abstract\
  \ (as in Categorial Grammar, Minimalism, HPSG and standard LFG). On the other hand\
  \ there are constructions that should be treated by very specific, phrasal schemata\
  \ as in Construction Grammar and LFG and HPSG. So the conclusion is that both schools\
  \ are right (and wrong) and that a combination of ideas from both camps is needed."

      <p>Stefan M\xFCller studied Computer Science, Computational Linguistics and\
      \ Linguistics at the Humboldt University at Berlin and in Edinburgh. He worked\
      \ at the German Research Center of Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) in Saarbr\xFC\
      cken and for the company Interice. He worked as acting chair for German and\
      \ Computational Linguistics in Jena and for Theoretical Computational Linguistics\
      \ in Potsdam. He had an assistant professorship in Bremen for theoretical linguistics\
      \ and computational linguistics, a full professorship for German and General\
      \ Linguistics at the Freie Universit\xE4t Berlin and is now professor for German\
      \ language with specialization in syntax at the Humboldt Universit\xE4t zu Berlin.</p>\r\
      \n<p>His main re\xADsearch topic is Ger\xADman gram\xADmar. He works both em\xAD\
      pir\xADi\xADcal\xADly and the\xADo\xADret\xADi\xADcal\xADly. Top\xADics of in\xAD\
      ter\xADest are mor\xADphol\xADo\xADgy, syn\xADtax, se\xADman\xADtics, and in\xAD\
      for\xADma\xADtion struc\xADture. He pub\xADlished main\xADly about Ger\xADman,\
      \ but he also works on other lan\xADguages as for in\xADstance Man\xADdarin\
      \ Chi\xADnese, Dan\xADish, Mal\xADtese, and Per\xADsian. The the\xADo\xADret\xAD\
      i\xADcal work is car\xADried out in the frame\xADwork of Head-? Driv\xADen Phrase\
      \ Struc\xADture Gram\xADmar (HPSG) and the the\xADo\xADret\xADi\xADcal anal\xAD\
      y\xADses are im\xADple\xADment\xADed in com\xADput\xADer-?pro\xADcess\xADable\
      \ gram\xADmar frag\xADments. The gram\xADmar frag\xADments that are implemented\
      \ in the CoreGram Project use a com\xADmon core. One goal of his re\xADsearch\
      \ is to un\xADder\xADstand lan\xADguage and to find out what lan\xADguages in\
      \ gen\xADer\xADal and cer\xADtain lan\xADguage class\xADes in par\xADtic\xAD\
