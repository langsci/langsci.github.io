blurb: "This book looks at some phenomena within the grammar of the noun phrase in\
  \ a group of traditional North Germanic varieties mainly spoken in Sweden and Finland,\
  \ usually seen as Swedish dialects, although the differences between them and Standard\
  \ Swedish are often larger than between the latter and the other standard Mainland\
  \ Scandinavian languages. In addition to being conservative in many respects \x96\
  \ e.g. in preserving nominal cases and subject-verb agreement \x96 these varieties\
  \ also display many innovative features. These include extended uses of definite\
  \ articles, incorporation of attributive adjectives, and a variety of possessive\
  \ constructions. Although considerable attention has been given to these phenomena\
  \ in earlier literature, this book is the first to put them in the perspective of\
  \ typology and grammaticalization processes. It also looks for a plausible account\
  \ of the historical origin of the changes involved, arguing that many of them spread\
  \ from central Sweden, where they were later reverted due to the influence from\
  \ prestige varieties coming from southern Scandinavia."
