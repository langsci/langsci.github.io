blurb: "Agreement is a pervasive phenomenon across natural languages. Depending on\
  \ one\x92s definition of what constitutes agreement, it is either found in virtually\
  \ every natural language that we know of, or it is at least found in a great many.\
  \ Either way, it seems to be a core part of the system that underpins our syntactic&nbsp;\
  \ knowledge. Since the introduction of the operation of Agree in Chomsky (2000),\
  \ agreement phenomena and the mechanism that underlies agreement have garnered a\
  \ lot of attention in the Minimalist literature and have received different theoretical\
  \ treatments at different stages. Since then, many different phenomena&nbsp; involving\
  \ dependencies between elements in syntax, including movement or not, have been\
  \ accounted for using Agree. The mechanism of Agree thus provides a powerful tool\
  \ to model dependencies between syntactic elements far beyond ?-feature agreement.\
  \ The articles collected in this volume further explore these topics&nbsp; and contribute\
  \ to the ongoing debates surrounding agreement. The authors gathered in this book\
  \ are internationally reknown experts in the field of Agreement."
