blurb: "This edited volume offers a collection of twelve interlinear texts reflecting\
  \ the vast linguistic diversity of Amazonia as well as the rich verbal arts and\
  \ oral literature traditions of Amazonian peoples. Contributions to the volume come\
  \ from a variety of geographic regions and represent the Carib, J\xEA, Tupi, East\
  \ Tukano, Nadahup, and Pano language families, as well as three linguistic isolates.\
  \ The selected texts exemplify a variety of narrative styles recounting the origins\
  \ of constellations, crops, and sacred cemeteries, and of travel to worlds beyond\
  \ death. We hear tales of tricksters and of encounters between humans and other\
  \ beings, learn of battles between enemies, and gain insight into history and the\
  \ indigenous perspective of creation, cordiality and confrontation.\r\nThe contributions\
  \ to this volume are the result of research efforts conducted since 2000, and as\
  \ such, exemplify rapidly expanding investment and interest in documenting native\
  \ Amazonian voices. They moreover demonstrate the collaborative efforts of linguists,\
  \ anthropologists, and indigenous leaders, storytellers, and researchers to study\
  \ and preserve Amazonian languages and cultures. Each chapter offers complete interlinear\
  \ analysis as well as ample commentary on both linguistic and cultural aspects,\
  \ appealing to a wide audience, including linguists, historians, anthropologists,\
  \ and other social scientists. This collection is the first of its type, constituting\
  \ a significant contribution to focused study of Amazonian linguistic diversity\
  \ and a relevant addition to our broader knowledge of Amerindian languages and cosmologies."
