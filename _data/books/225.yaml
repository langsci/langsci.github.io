blurb: 'This book is an investigation into the grammar of Mehweb (Dargwa, East Caucasian
  also known as Nakh-Daghestanian) based on several years of team fieldwork. Mehweb
  is spoken in one village community in Daghestan, Russia, with a population of some
  800 people, In many ways, Mehweb is a typical East Caucasian language: it has a
  rich inventory of consonants; an extensive system of spatial forms in nouns and
  converbs and volitional forms in verbs; pervasive gender-number agreement; and ergative
  alignment in case marking and in gender agreement. It is also a typical language
  of the Dargwa branch, with symmetrical verb inflection in the imperfective and perfective
  paradigm and extensive use of spatial encoding for experiencers. Although Mehweb
  is clearly close to the northern varieties of Dargwa, it has been long isolated
  from the main body of Dargwa varieties by speakers of Avar and Lak. As a result
  of both independent internal evolution and contact with its neighbours, Mehweb developed
  some deviant properties, including accusatively aligned egophoric agreement, a split
  in the feminine class, and the typologically rare grammatical categories of verificative
  and apprehensive. But most importantly, Mehweb is where our friends live.'
