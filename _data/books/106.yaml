blurb: "This volume of the series \x93Translation and Multilingual Natural Language\
  \ Processing\x94 includes most of the papers presented at the Workshop \x93Language\
  \ Technology for a Multilingual Europe\x94, held at the University of Hamburg on\
  \ September 27, 2011 in the framework of the conference GSCL 2011 with the topic\
  \ \x93Multilingual Resources and Multilingual Applications\x94, along with several\
  \ additional contributions. In addition to an overview article on Machine Translation\
  \ and two contributions on the European initiatives META-NET and Multilingual Web,\
  \ the volume includes six full research articles. Our intention with this workshop\
  \ was to bring together various groups concerned with the umbrella topics of multilingualism\
  \ and language technology, especially multilingual technologies. This encompassed,\
  \ on the one hand, representatives from research and development in the field of\
  \ language technologies, and, on the other hand, users from diverse areas such as,\
  \ among others, industry, administration and funding agencies. The Workshop \x93\
  Language Technology for a Multilingual Europe\x94 was co-organised by the two GSCL\
  \ working groups \x93Text Technology\x94 and \x93Machine Translation\x94 (<a href=\"\
  http://gscl.info\">http://gscl.info</a>) as well as by META-NET (<a href=\"http://www.meta-net.eu\"\
  >http://www.meta-net.eu</a>)."
