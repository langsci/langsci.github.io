  en-GB\">Companies and organisations are increasingly using machine translation to\
  \ improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness, and then edit the machine translated\
  \ output to create a fluent text that adheres to given text conventions. This procedure\

  ><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Translation and post-editing\
  \ can often be categorised as problem-solving activities. When the translation of\
  \ a source text unit is not immediately obvious to the translator, or in other words,\
  \ if there is a hurdle between the source item and the target item, the translation\
  \ process can be considered problematic. Conversely, if there is no hurdle between\
  \ the source and target texts, the translation process can be considered a task-solving\
  \ activity and not a problem-solving activity. </span></span></span>\r\n<p style=\"\

  \ investigates whether machine translated output influences problem-solving effort\
  \ in internet research, syntax, and other problem indicators and whether the effort\
  \ can be linked to expertise. A total of 24 translators (twelve professionals and\
  \ twelve semi-professionals) produced translations from scratch from English into\
  \ German, and (monolingually) post-edited machine translation output for this study.\
  \ The study is part of the CRITT TPR-DB database. The translation and (monolingual)\
  \ post-editing sessions were recorded with an eye-tracker and a keylogging program.\
  \ The participants were all given the same six texts (two texts per task).</span></span></span>\r\

  \ Times\\ New\\ Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"\
  en-GB\">Different approaches were used to identify problematic translation units.\
  \ First, internet research behaviour was considered as research is a distinct indicator\
  \ of problematic translation units. Then, the focus was placed on syntactical structures\
  \ in the MT output that do not adhere to the rules of the target language, as I\
  \ assumed that they would cause problems in the (monolingual) post-editing tasks\
  \ that would not occur in the translation from scratch task. Finally, problem indicators\
  \ were identified via different parameters like </span></span></span><span style=\"\

  \ lang=\"en-GB\"><em>Munit,</em></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family:\
  \ Times\\ New\\ Roman, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"\
  en-GB\"> which indicates how often the participants created and modified one translation\
  \ unit, or the inefficiency (</span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times\\\

  ><em>InEff</em></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Times\\ New\\ Roman,\
  \ serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">) value of translation\
  \ units, i.e. the number of produced and deleted tokens divided by the final length\
  \ of the translation. Finally, the study highlights how these parameters can be\
  \ used to identify problems in the translation process data using mere keylogging\
  \ data.</span></span></span>"
