blurb: "Multiword expressions (MWEs), such as noun compounds (e.g. <em>nickname</em>\
  \ in English, and <em>Ohrwurm</em> in German), complex verbs (e.g. <em>give up</em>\
  \ in English, and <em>aufgeben</em> in German) and idioms (e.g. <em>break the ice</em>\
  \ in English, and <em>das Eis brechen</em> in German), may be interpreted literally\
  \ but often undergo meaning shifts with respect to their constituents. Theoretical,\
  \ psycholinguistic as well as computational linguistic research remain puzzled by\
  \ when and how MWEs receive literal vs. meaning-shifted interpretations, what the\
  \ contributions of the MWE constituents are to the degree of semantic transparency\
  \ (i.e., meaning compositionality) of the MWE, and how literal vs. meaning-shifted\
  \ MWEs are processed and computed. This edited volume presents an interdisciplinary\
  \ selection of six papers on recent findings across linguistic, psycholinguistic,\
  \ corpus-based and computational research fields and perspectives, discussing the\
  \ interaction of constituent properties and MWE meanings, and how MWE constituents\
  \ contribute to the processing and representation of MWEs. The collection is based\
  \ on a workshop at the 2017 annual conference of the German Linguistic Society (DGfS)\
  \ that took place at Saarland University in Saarbr\xFCcken, Germany"
