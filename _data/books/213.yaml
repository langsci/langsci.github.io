blurb: 'Constructions with multiple verbal elements have posed a long-standing challenge
  to linguistic analysis. Most studies of verb serialisation have been confined to
  single languages rather than looking at crosslinguistic patterns. This book provides
  the first in-depth account into the areal characteristics of multi-verb constructions
  (MVCs) in Eastern Indonesia. By collating published data as well as corpus data
  from 32 Austronesian and Papuan languages, the study traces commonalities as well
  as differences in MVC use across the area. Analysis takes place on two levels: first,
  the morpho-syntactic behaviour of MVCs is taken into account. As this plane of analysis
  arguably does not provide any meaningful insights into why MVCs are construed and
  used the way they are, a semantic account of MVCs is presented. One of the main
  hypotheses advanced in this book is that the crucial driving force behind multi-verb
  construals is semantic interaction between the verbs, leading to four principal
  techniques of event formation: merging, staging, modification, and free juxtaposition.
  The study aims at showing that while all four techniques are, to varying degrees,
  in use in Eastern Indonesian languages, the morpho-syntactic output does not necessarily
  mirror these underlying differences in event conception. Applying insights from
  Davidsonian event semantics as well as from predicate decomposition, the book provides
  a model of event interaction that helps to explain differences in MVC behaviour
  such as issues in constituent order or operator assignment.'
