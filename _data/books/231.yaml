blurb: "This book provides an introduction to the study of meaning in human language,\
  \ from a linguistic perspective. It covers a fairly broad range of topics, including\
  \ lexical semantics, compositional semantics, and pragmatics. The chapters are organized\
  \ into six units: (1) Foundational concepts; (2) Word meanings; (3) Implicature\
  \ (including indirect speech acts); (4) Compositional semantics; (5) Modals, conditionals,\
  \ and causation; (6) Tense &amp; aspect.\r\nMost of the chapters include exercises\
  \ which can be used for class discussion and/or homework assignments, and each chapter\
  \ contains references for additional reading on the topics covered.\r\nAs the title\
  \ indicates, this book is truly an INTRODUCTION: it provides a solid foundation\
  \ which will prepare students to take more advanced and specialized courses in semantics\
  \ and/or pragmatics. It is also intended as a reference for fieldworkers doing primary\
  \ research on under-documented languages, to help them write grammatical descriptions\
  \ that deal carefully and clearly with semantic issues. The approach adopted here\
  \ is largely descriptive and non-formal (or, in some places, semi-formal), although\
  \ some basic logical notation is introduced. The book is written at level which\
  \ should be appropriate for advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate students.\
  \ It presupposes some previous coursework in linguistics, but does not presuppose\
  \ any background in formal logic or set theory.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis is a revised version\
  \ of <a href=\"http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/144\">http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/144</a>"
