blurb: "This book introduces formal grammar theories that play a role in current linguistic\
  \ theorizing (Phrase Structure Grammar, Transformational Grammar/Government &amp;\
  \ Binding, Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar, Lexical Functional Grammar, Categorial\
  \ Grammar, Head-?Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, Construction Grammar, Tree Adjoining\
  \ Grammar). The key assumptions are explained and it is shown how the respective\
  \ theory treats arguments and adjuncts, the active/passive alternation, local reorderings,\
  \ verb placement, and fronting of constituents over long distances. The analyses\
  \ are explained with German as the object language.\r\nThe second part of the book\
  \ compares these approaches with respect to their predictions regarding language\
  \ acquisition and psycholinguistic plausibility. The nativism hypothesis, which\
  \ assumes that humans posses genetically determined innate language-specific knowledge,\
  \ is critically examined and alternative models of language acquisition are discussed.\
  \ The second part then addresses controversial issues of current theory building\
  \ such as the question of flat or binary branching structures being more appropriate,\
  \ the question whether constructions should be treated on the phrasal or the lexical\
  \ level, and the question whether abstract, non-visible entities should play a role\
  \ in syntactic analyses. It is shown that the analyses suggested in the respective\
  \ frameworks are often translatable into each other. The book closes with a chapter\
  \ showing how properties common to all languages or to certain classes of languages\
  \ can be captured.\r\nThe book is a translation of the German book <a href=\"http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/~stefan/Pub/grammatiktheorie.html\"\
  >Grammatiktheorie</a>, which was published by Stauffenburg in 2010. The following\
  \ quotes are taken from reviews:\r\n<q>With this critical yet fair reflection on\
  \ various grammatical theories, M\xFCller fills what was a major gap in the literature.</q>\
