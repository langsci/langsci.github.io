blurb: The papers in this volume were presented at the 47th Annual Conference on African
  Linguistics at UC Berkeley in 2016. The papers offer new descriptions of African
  languages and propose novel theoretical analyses of them. The contributions span
  topics in phonetics, phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics and reflect the
  typological and genetic diversity of languages in Africa. Four papers in the volume
  examine Areal Features and Linguistic Reconstruction in Africa, and were presented
  at a special workshop on this topic held alongside the general session of ACAL.
