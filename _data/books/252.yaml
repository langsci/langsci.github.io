blurb: "<div class=\"\">This volume contains thematic papers on semantic change which\
  \ emerged from the second edition of Formal Diachronic Semantics held at Saarland\
  \ University. Its authorship ranges from established scholars in the field of language\
  \ change to advanced PhD students whose contributions have equally qualified and\
  \ have been selected after a two-step peer-review process.</div>\r\n<div class=\"\
  \">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"\">The key foci are variablity and diachronic trajectories\
  \ in scale structures and quantification, but readers will also find a variety of\
  \ further (and clearly non-disjoint) issues covered &nbsp;including reference, modality,\
  \ givenness, presuppositions, alternatives in language change, temporality, epistemic\
  \ indefiniteness, as well as - in more general terms - &nbsp;the interfaces of semantics\
  \ with syntax, pragmatics and morphology.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div class=\"\">&nbsp;</div>\r\
  \n<div class=\"\">Given the nature of the field, the contributions are primarily\
  \ based on original corpus studies (in one case also on synchronic experimental\
  \ data) and present a series of new findings and theoretical analyses of several\
  \ languages, first and foremost from &nbsp;the Germanic and Romance subbranches\
  \ of Indo-European (English, French, German, Italian, Spanish) and from Semitic\
  \ (with an analysis of universal quantification in Biblical Hebrew).</div>"
