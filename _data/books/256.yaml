blurb: 'This book presents a hypothesis-based description of the clausal structure
  of German Sign Language (DGS). The structure of the book is based on the three clausal
  layers CP, IP/TP, and VoiceP. The main hypothesis is that scopal height is expressed
  iconically in sign languages: the higher the scope of an operator, the higher the
  articulator used for its expression. The book was written with two audiences in
  mind: On the one hand it addresses linguists interested in sign languages and on
  the other hand it addresses cartographers.'
