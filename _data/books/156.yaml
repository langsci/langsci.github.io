blurb: 'This collection of papers on phrasal compounding is part of a bigger project
  whose aims are twofold: First, it seeks to broaden the typological perspective by
  providing data for as many different languages as possible to gain a better understanding
  of the phenomenon itself. Second, based on these data which clearly show interaction
  between syntax and morphology it aims to discuss theoretical models which deal with
  this kind of interaction in different ways. Models like Generative Grammar assume
  components of grammar and a clear-cut distinction between the lexicon (often including
  morphology) and grammar. Other models, like construction grammar, do not assume
  such components and are rather based on a lexicon including constructs. A comparison
  of these models on the basis of this phenomenon on the morphology-syntax interface
  makes it possible to assess their descriptive and explanatory power.'
