blurb: "Many descriptive grammars report the use of a linguistic pattern at the interface\
  \ between discourse and syntax which is known generally as <em>tail-head linkage</em>.\
  \ This volume takes an unprecedented look at this type of linkage across languages\
  \ and shows that there exist three distinct variants, all subsumed under the hypernym\
  \ <em>bridging constructions</em>. The chapters highlight the defining features\
  \ of these constructions in the grammar and their functional properties in discourse.\
  \ The volume reveals that:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Bridging constructions consist of two\
  \ clauses: a reference clause and a bridging clause. Across languages, bridging\
  \ clauses can be subordinated clauses, reduced main clauses, or main clauses with\
  \ continuation prosody.</li>\r\n<li>Bridging constructions have three variants:\
  \ <em>recapitulative linkage</em>, <em>summary linkage</em> and <em>mixed linkage</em>.\
  \ They differ in the formal makeup of the bridging clause.</li>\r\n<li>In discourse,\
  \ the functions that bridging constructions fulfil depend on the text genres in\
  \ which they appear and their position in the text.</li>\r\n<li>If a language uses\
  \ more than one type of bridging construction, then each type has a distinct discourse\
  \ function.</li>\r\n<li>Bridging constructions can be optional and purely stylistic\
  \ or mandatory and serve a grammatical purpose.</li>\r\n<li>Although the difference\
  \ between bridging constructions and clause repetition can be subtle, they maintain\
  \ their own distinctive characteristics.</li>\r\n</ul>"
