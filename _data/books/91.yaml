blurb: "<i>Roots of language</i> was originally published in 1981 by Karoma Press\
  \ (Ann Arbor).  It was the first work to systematically develop a theory first suggested\
  \ by Coelho in the late nineteenth century:  that the creation of creole languages\
  \ somehow reflected universal properties of language.  The book also proposed that\
  \ the same set of properties would be found to emerge in normal first-language acquisition\
  \ and must have emerged in the original evolution of language.  These proposals,\
  \ some of which were elaborated in an article in <i>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</i>\
  \ (1984), were immediately controversial and gave rise to a great deal of subsequent\
  \ research in creoles, much of it aimed at rebutting the theory.  The book also\
  \ served to legitimize and stimulate research in language evolution, a topic regarded\
  \ as off-limits by linguists for over a century.  The present edition contains a\
  \ foreword by the author bringing the theory up to date; a fuller exposition of\
  \ many of its aspects can be found in the author\x92s most recent work, <i>More\
  \ than nature needs</i> (Harvard University Press, 2014)."
