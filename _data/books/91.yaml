blurb:  "<i>Roots of language</i> was originally published in 1981 by Karoma Press (Ann Arbor).  It was the first work to systematically develop a theory first suggested by Coelho in the late nineteenth century:  that the creation of creole languages somehow reflected universal properties of language.  The book also proposed that the same set of properties would be found to emerge in normal first-language acquisition and must have emerged in the original evolution of language.  These proposals, some of which were elaborated in an article in <i>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</i> (1984), were immediately controversial and gave rise to a great deal of subsequent research in creoles, much of it aimed at rebutting the theory.  The book also served to legitimize and stimulate research in language evolution, a topic regarded as off-limits by linguists for over a century.  The present edition contains a foreword by the author bringing the theory up to date; a fuller exposition of many of its aspects can be found in the author’s most recent work, <i>More than nature needs</i> (Harvard University Press, 2014)."
