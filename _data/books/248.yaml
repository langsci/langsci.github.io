blurb: "<em>Communication and content</em> presents a comprehensive and foundational\
  \ account of meaning based on new versions of situation theory and game theory.\
  \ The literal and implied meanings of an utterance are derived from first principles\
  \ assuming little more than the partial rationality of interacting agents. New analyses\
  \ of a number of diverse phenomena \x96 a wide notion of ambiguity and content encompassing\
  \ phonetics, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and beyond, vagueness, convention and\
  \ conventional meaning, indeterminacy, universality, the role of truth in communication,\
  \ semantic change, translation, Frege\x92s puzzle of informative identities \x96\
  \ are developed. Communication, speaker meaning, and reference are defined. Frege\x92\
  s context and compositional principles are generalized and reconciled in a fixed-point\
  \ principle, and a detailed critique of Grice, several aspects of Lewis, and some\
  \ aspects of the Romantic conception of meaning are offered. Connections with other\
  \ branches of linguistics, especially psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, historical\
  \ linguistics, and natural language processing, are explored.<br><br>The book will\
  \ be of interest to scholars in philosophy, linguistics, artificial intelligence,\
  \ and cognitive science. It should also interest readers in related fields like\
  \ literary and cultural theory and the social sciences.\r\n<hr>\r\n\"This book is\
  \ the culmination of Prashant Parikh's long and deep work on fundamental questions\
  \ of language and how they can be illuminated by game-theoretic analysis.\"<br>\x97\

  \ Parikh has, over the years, accumulated a substantial and impressive body of work\
  \ on the nature of language, deploying the resources of game theory. <em>Communication\
  \ and content</em> is a vastly ambitious culmination of this lifelong pursuit. It\
  \ covers a tremendously wide range of themes and critically discusses an enormous\
  \ range of writing on those themes from diverse intellectual traditions, as it systematically\
  \ develops a game-theoretic account of content in the communicative contexts in\
  \ which human linguistic capacities are employed, eschewing standard distinctions\
  \ between semantics and pragmatics, and offering instead a highly integrated elaboration\
  \ of the slogan \x93meaning is use\x94. It is a work that is at once creative yet\
  \ conscientious, bold yet rigorously technical, systematic yet sensitive to contingency\
  \ and context. It will abundantly reward close study.\"<br>\x97 Akeel Bilgrami,\
  \ Sidney Morgenbesser Professor of Philosophy, Columbia University\r\n\"Prashant\
  \ Parikh has made fundamental contributions to the game-theoretic analysis of linguistic\
  \ meaning. <em>Communication and content</em> summarizes and extends this important\
  \ work, offering a truly novel approach to the strategic foundations of meaning.\
  \ This approach finds a way out of the prison of methodological solipsism and opens\
  \ up the study of linguistic meaning to scientific study.\"<br>\x97 Robin Clark,\
  \ Linguistics, University of Pennsylvania\r\n\"A pioneering attempt to work out\
  \ things like literal meaning, modulation, enrichment, implicature, etc. in mathematical\
  \ detail within a game-theoretic framework.\"<br>\x97 Fran\xE7ois Recanati, Chair,\
  \ Philosophy of Language and Mind, Coll\xE8ge de France<br><br><em>\"Communication\
  \ and content</em> is the crowning achievement of a long line of research pioneered\
  \ by Prashant Parikh. In this groundbreaking work Parikh introduces a fresh perspective\
  \ on natural language pragmatics, by making a creative tie with game theory. Clearly\
  \ written, <em>Communication and content</em> weaves together semantics, game theory,\
  \ and situation theory to create a thought-provoking picture of natural language\
  \ pragmatics. Every modern AI researcher interested in the foundations of natural\
  \ language pragmatics owes it to him- or herself to become familiar with this picture.\"\
