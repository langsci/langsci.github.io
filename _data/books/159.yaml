blurb: "This book reconsiders the role of order and structure in syntax, focusing\
  \ on fundamental issues such as word order and grammatical functions. The first\
  \ group of papers in the collection asks what word order can tell us about syntactic\
  \ structure, using evidence from V2, object shift, word order gaps and different\
  \ kinds of movement. The second group of papers all address the issue of subjecthood\
  \ in some way, and examine how certain subject properties vary across languages:\
  \ expression of subjects, expletive subjects, quirky and locative subjects. All\
  \ of the papers address in some way the tension between modelling what can vary\
  \ across languages whilst improving our understanding of what might be universal\
  \ to human language.\r\nThis book is complemented by <a href=\"http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/115\"\
