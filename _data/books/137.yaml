blurb: 'In most languages, words contain vowels, elements of high intensity with rich
  harmonic structure, enabling the &nbsp;perceptual retrieval of pitch. By contrast,
  in Tashlhiyt, a Berber language, words can be composed entirely of voiceless segments.
  When an utterance consists of such words, the phonetic opportunity for the execution
  of intonational pitch movements is exceptionally limited. This book explores in
  a series of production and perception experiments how these typologically rare phonotactic
  patterns interact with intonational aspects of linguistic structure. It turns out
  that Tashlhiyt allows for a tremendously flexible placement of tonal events. Observed
  intonational structures can be conceived of as different solutions to a functional
  dilemma: The requirement to realise meaningful pitch movements in certain positions
  and the extent to which segments lend themselves to a clear manifestation of these
  pitch movements.'

  - [Timo, B., Roettger, '<p>Timo B. Roettger studied General Linguistics and Phonetics
      in Cologne and Edinburgh. His research interests centre around the question
      of how multidimensional, continuous aspects of speech can be related to discrete
      aspects of cognition. He attempts to answer this question by investigating how
      communicative functions are phonetically encoded during speech production, and
      how and when aspects of the speech signal are retrieved during speech perception.
      His recent work has appeared in <em>Journal of Phonetics</em>, <em>Phonology</em>,
      and <em>Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology</em>. Since finishing his
      PhD in Phonetics, he is currently working as a post-doc researcher in Cologne,
      investigating the time course of prosody-based intention recognition.</p>']
