blurb: "After celebrating the International workshop \xAB&nbsp;Spanish varieties in\
  \ contact or heterogeneous language practices&nbsp;\xBB in Paris in 2017, this volume\
  \ brings together thirteen scientific contributions offering a change of perspective\
  \ on the description of contact-induced variation and change phenomena in the Spanish-speaking\
  \ world, based on new methodological and theoretical frameworks. This change of\
  \ perspective implies to move from the analysis of \x93systems\x94 and \x93codes\x94\
  \ in contact, and its outcomes, to the description and analysis of heterogeneous\
  \ language practices that focuses on the use of semiotic and linguistic resources\
  \ by speakers to express messages, to transmit knowledge, or to take positions and\
  \ epistemic and affective stances, that is, to create meaning. The aim of this book\
  \ is to question, from different perspectives and backgrounds, the notion of contact\
  \ as just simply the influence of systems or codes and, rather, to propose a dynamic\
  \ view centered on the use of linguistic heterogeneous resources by social actors\
  \ living in complex contact settings involving the contact of languages such as\
  \ Spanish, Quechua, Guaran\xED, Yukuna, Mapuzug\xFAn, Otom\xED, Chichimeca jonaz,\
  \ and Tepehuano del sureste. This book brings together contributions from well-known\
  \ specialists and young researchers of language contact such as Carol Klee, Azucena\
  \ Palacios, Uli Reich, Isabelle L\xE9glise, Carola Mick, Marleen Haboud, Aura Lemus,\
  \ Magdalena Lemus, Ignacio Satti, Rosa Morales, Daniel Muz, Stefan Pf\xE4nder y\
  \ Mario Soto Jorge G\xF3mez Rend\xF3n, Aldo Olate Vinet, Nadiezdha Torres S\xE1\
  nchez, \xC9lodie Blestel, and Santiago S\xE1nchez Moreano. The volume is divided\
  \ in two sections. The first one: \xAB&nbsp;methodological and theoretical perspectives&nbsp;\xBB\
  \ includes five contributions offering innovative guidelines and perspectives for\
  \ the study of contact-induced variation and change. These perspectives, although\
  \ they have been widely worked in linguistic anthropology and ethnographic sociolinguistics,\
  \ for example, has been on the contrary not yet well explored in the field of language\
  \ contact in the \x93Spanish-speaking world\x94. The second section is entitled\
  \ \x93Case studies and applied perspectives\x94 and includes seven contributions\
  \ offering new theoretically and methodologically views on language contact."
