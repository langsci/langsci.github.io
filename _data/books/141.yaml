blurb: Nyakyusa is an underdescribed Bantu language spoken by around 800.000 speakers
  in the Mbeya Region of Tanzania. This book provides a detailled description of the
  verb in this language. The topics covered include the complex morphophonological
  and morphological processes as well as verb-to-verb derivation, copula verbs and
  grammaticalized verbs of motion. The main body of the book consists of a detailed
  description of tense, aspect and modality constructions, which includes not only
  an in-depth discussion of their sentence level semantics, but also of their patterns
  of employment in discourse.
