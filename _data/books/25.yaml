blurb: "This book is superseded by the third edition, available at <a href=\"http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/255\"\
  >http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/255.</a>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis book introduces\
  \ formal grammar theories that play a role in current linguistic theorizing (Phrase\
  \ Structure Grammar, Transformational Grammar/Government &amp; Binding, Generalized\
  \ Phrase Structure Grammar, Lexical Functional Grammar, Categorial Grammar, Head-?Driven\
  \ Phrase Structure Grammar, Construction Grammar, Tree Adjoining Grammar). The key\
  \ assumptions are explained and it is shown how the respective theory treats arguments\
  \ and adjuncts, the active/passive alternation, local reorderings, verb placement,\
  \ and fronting of constituents over long distances. The analyses are explained with\
  \ German as the object language.\r\nThe second part of the book compares these approaches\
  \ with respect to their predictions regarding language acquisition and psycholinguistic\
  \ plausibility. The nativism hypothesis, which assumes that humans posses genetically\
  \ determined innate language-specific knowledge, is critically examined and alternative\
  \ models of language acquisition are discussed. The second part then addresses controversial\
  \ issues of current theory building such as the question of flat or binary branching\
  \ structures being more appropriate, the question whether constructions should be\
  \ treated on the phrasal or the lexical level, and the question whether abstract,\
  \ non-visible entities should play a role in syntactic analyses. It is shown that\
  \ the analyses suggested in the respective frameworks are often translatable into\
  \ each other. The book closes with a chapter showing how properties common to all\
  \ languages or to certain classes of languages can be captured.\r\nThe book is a\
  \ translation of the German book <a href=\"http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/~stefan/Pub/grammatiktheorie.html\"\
  >Grammatiktheorie</a>, which was published by Stauffenburg in 2010. The following\
  \ quotes are taken from reviews:\r\n<q>With this critical yet fair reflection on\
  \ various grammatical theories, M\xFCller fills what was a major gap in the literature.</q>\
