blurb: "Throughout much of the history of linguistics, grammaticality judgments \x96\
  \ intuitions about the well-formedness of sentences \x96 have constituted most of\
  \ the empirical base against which theoretical hypothesis have been tested. Although\
  \ such judgments often rest on subtle intuitions, there is no systematic methodology\
  \ for eliciting them, and their apparent instability and unreliability have led\
  \ many to conclude that they should be abandoned as a source of data.\n<br /><br\
  \ />\nCarson T. Sch\xFCtze presents here a detailed critical overview of the vast\
  \ literature on the nature and utility of grammaticality judgments and other linguistic\
  \ intuitions, and the ways they have been used in linguistic research. He shows\
  \ how variation in the judgment process can arise from factors such as biological,\
  \ cognitive, and social differences among subjects, the particular elicitation method\
  \ used, and extraneous features of the materials being judged. He then assesses\
  \ the status of judgments as reliable indicators of a speaker's grammar.\n<br /><br\
  \ />\nIntegrating substantive and methodological findings, Sch\xFCtze proposes a\
  \ model in which grammaticality judgments result from interaction of linguistic\
  \ competence with general cognitive processes. He argues that this model provides\
  \ the underpinning for empirical arguments to show that once extragrammatical variance\
  \ is factored out, universal grammar succumbs to a simpler, more elegant analysis\
  \ than judgment data initially lead us to expect. Finally, Sch\xFCtze offers numerous\
  \ practical suggestions on how to collect better and more useful data. The result\
  \ is a work of vital importance that will be required reading for linguists, cognitive\
  \ psychologists, and philosophers of language alike.\n<br /><br />\n\"Native speakers'\
  \ judgments of the acceptability of linguistic examples have always formed a major\
  \ part of the data of linguistics, but linguists generally either have elicited\
  \ such data in a haphazard fashion and accepted the results uncritically or have\
  \ rejected acceptability judgments altogether and equally uncritically. Sch\xFC\
  tze's book is a welcome relief from the failure of linguists to deal responsibly\
  \ with what can be either the most fertile or the most misleading source of information\
  \ about languages.\"<br />\x97James D. McCawley, University of Chicago\n<br /><br\
  \ />\n\"Sch\xFCtze has written an extraordinarily useful and timely book. In it,\
  \ he provides a clear and readable review of past studies of the methodology of\
  \ generative syntax. But this is not merely a survey: it is also a call for more\
  \ careful and objective scientific methods in syntax, including a set of practical\
  \ methodological suggestions for working syntacticians. If heeded, they will greatly\
  \ strengthen the empirical base of linguistic theory.\"<br />\x97Tom Wasow, Stanford\
