blurb: "This volume investigates the realisation and perception of four phonological\
  \ variables in Liverpool English (Scouse), with a special focus on their sociolinguistic\
  \ salience. Younger speakers\x92 speech is found to be more local, but only for\
  \ the two salient variables in the sample (NURSE-SQUARE and /k/ lenition), which\
  \ appear to carry considerable amounts of covert prestige. Local variants of non-salient\
  \ happy-tensing and velar nasal plus, on the other hand, are actually found to be\
  \ receding, so at least to a certain extent Scouse also seems to be participating\
  \ in regional dialect levelling. The importance of salience is also obvious in the\
  \ perception data, with only the two highly salient stereotypes generating robust\
  \ effects in a social priming experiment (albeit in the unexpected direction). These\
  \ results indicate that the investigated variables differ measurably not only in\
  \ their use in production, but also in terms of how central they are to mental sociolinguistic\
  \ representations of Scouse. They also tell us more about the way we process, store,\
  \ and (re-)use sociolinguistic variation in perception. By defining likely contexts\
  \ for significant priming effects they might finally even help in coming up with\
  \ a more elaborate \x93theory of priming\x94 in the realm of sociophonetics.<br><br>"
