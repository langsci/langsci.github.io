blurb: The contributions to this volume investigate relations of cohesion and coherence
  as well as instantiations of discourse phenomena and their interaction with information
  structure in multilingual contexts. Some contributions concentrate on procedures
  to analyze cohesion and coherence from a corpus-linguistic perspective. Others have
  a particular focus on textual cohesion in parallel corpora that include both originals
  and translated texts. Additionally, the papers in the volume discuss the nature
  of cohesion and coherence with implications for human and machine translation.<br>The
  contributors are experts on discourse phenomena and textuality who address these
  issues from an empirical perspective. The chapters in this volume are grounded in
  the latest research making this book useful to both experts of discourse studies
  and computational linguistics, as well as advanced students with an interest in
  these disciplines. We hope that this volume will serve as a catalyst to other researchers
  and will facilitate further advances in the development of cost-effective annotation
  procedures, the application of statistical techniques for the analysis of linguistic
  phenomena and the elaboration of new methods for data interpretation in multilingual
  corpus linguistics and machine translation.
