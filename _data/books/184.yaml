blurb: Multiword expressions (MWEs) are a challenge for both the natural language
  applications and the linguistic theory because they often defy the application of
  the machinery developed for free combinations where the default is that the meaning
  of an utterance can be predicted from its structure. There is a rich body of primarily
  descriptive work on MWEs for many European languages but comparative work is little.
  The volume brings together MWE experts to explore the benefits of a multilingual
  perspective on MWEs. The ten contributions in this volume look at MWEs in Bulgarian,
  English, French, German, Maori, Modern Greek, Romanian, Serbian, and Spanish. They
  discuss prominent issues in MWE research such as classification of MWEs, their formal
  grammatical modeling, and the description of individual MWE types from the point
  of view of different theoretical frameworks, such as Dependency Grammar, Generative
  Grammar, Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar, Lexical Functional Grammar, Lexicon
  Grammar.
