blurb: "The expression of knowledge in language (i.e. epistemicity) consists of a\
  \ number of distinct notions and proposed categories that are only partly related\
  \ to a well explored forms like epistemic modals. The aim of the volume is therefore\
  \ to contribute to the ongoing exploration of epistemic marking systems in lesser-documented\
  \ languages from the Americas, Papua New Guinea, and Central Asia from the perspective\
  \ of language&nbsp;description and cross-linguistic comparison. As the title of\
  \ the volume suggests, part of this exploration consists of situating already established\
  \ notions (such as evidentiality) with the diversity of systems found in individual\
  \ languages. Epistemic forms&nbsp;that feature in the present volume include ones\
  \ that singal&nbsp;how speakers claim knowledge based on perceptual-cognitive access\
  \ (evidentials); the speaker\x92s involvement as a basis for claiming epistemic\
  \ authority (egophorics); the distribution of knowledge between the speech-participants\
  \ where the speaker signals assumptions about the addressee\x92s knowledge of an\
  \ event as either shared, or non-shared with the speaker (engagement marking).&nbsp;\r\
