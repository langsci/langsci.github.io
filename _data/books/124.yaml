blurb: "This book is a comprehensive description of the grammar of Rapa Nui, the Polynesian\
  \ language spoken on Easter Island. After an introductory chapter, the grammar deals\
  \ with phonology, word classes, the noun phrase, possession, the verb phrase, verbal\
  \ and nonverbal clauses, mood and negation, and clause combinations. The phonology\
  \ of Rapa Nui reveals certain issues of typological interest, such as the existence\
  \ of strict conditions on the phonological shape of words, word-final devoicing,\
  \ and reduplication patterns motivated by metrical constraints. For Polynesian languages,\
  \ the distinction between nouns and verbs in the lexicon has often been denied;\
  \ in this grammar it is argued that this distinction is needed for Rapa Nui. Rapa\
  \ Nui has sometimes been characterised as an ergative language; this grammar shows\
  \ that it is unambiguously accusative. Subject and object marking depend on an interplay\
  \ of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic factors. Other distinctive features of the\
  \ language include the existence of a \x91neutral\x92 aspect marker, a serial verb\
  \ construction, the emergence of copula verbs, a possessive-relative construction,\
  \ and a tendency to maximise the use of the nominal domain. Rapa Nui\x92s relationship\
  \ to the other Polynesian languages is a recurring theme in this grammar; the relationship\
  \ to Tahitian (which has profoundly influenced Rapa Nui) especially deserves attention.\
  \ The grammar is supplemented with a number of interlinear texts, two maps and a\
  \ subject index."
