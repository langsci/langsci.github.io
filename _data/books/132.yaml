blurb: 'Empirical research is carried out in a cyclic way: approaching a research
  area bottom-up, data lead to interpretations and ideally to the abstraction of laws,
  on the basis of which a theory can be derived. Deductive research is based on a
  theory, on the basis of which hypotheses can be formulated and tested against the
  background of empirical data. Looking at the state-of-the-art in translation studies,
  either theories as well as models are designed or empirical data are collected and
  interpreted. However, the final step is still lacking: so far, empirical data has
  not lead to the formulation of theories or models, whereas existing theories and
  models have not yet been comprehensively tested with empirical methods.<br> <br>This
  publication addresses these issues from several perspectives: multi-method product-
  as well as process-based research may gain insights into translation as well as
  interpreting phenomena. These phenomena may include cognitive and organizational
  processes, procedures and strategies, competence and performance, translation properties
  and universals, etc. Empirical findings about the deeper structures of translation
  and interpreting will reduce the gap between translation and interpreting practice
  and model and theory building. Furthermore, the availability of more large-scale
  empirical testing triggers the development of models and theories concerning translation
  and interpreting phenomena and behavior based on quantifiable, replicable and transparent
  data.'
