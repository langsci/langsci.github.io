blurb: "Exchange between the translation studies and the computational linguistics\
  \ communities has traditionally not been very intense. Among other things, this\
  \ is reflected by the different views on parallel corpora. While computational linguistics\
  \ does not always strictly pay attention to the translation direction (e.g. when\
  \ translation rules are extracted from (sub)corpora which actually only consist\
  \ of translations), translation studies are amongst other things concerned with\
  \ exactly comparing source and target texts (e.g. to draw conclusions on interference\
  \ and standardization effects). However, there has recently been more exchange between\
  \ the two fields \x96 especially when it comes to the annotation of parallel corpora.\
  \ This special issue brings together the different research perspectives. Its contributions\
  \ show \x96 from both perspectives \x96 how the communities have come to interact\
  \ in recent years."

      in computational linguistics and his PhD in machine translation. His thesis
      work focused on developing ways of automatically comparing verb valence between
      English and German using parallel corpora. During a one-year stay at ICSI at
      the University of California in Berkeley in 2011 and 2012, he worked with researchers
      in the FrameNet Project, who are building a lexical database based on frame
      semantic analyses. He is interested in how grammar and semantics interact in
      translation.']
