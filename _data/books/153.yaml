blurb: 'What is semantic transparency, why is it important, and which factors play
  a role in its assessment? This work approaches these questions by investigating
  English compound nouns. The first part of the book gives an overview of semantic
  transparency in the analysis of compound nouns, discussing its role in models of
  morphological processing and differentiating it from related notions. After a chapter
  on the semantic analysis of complex nominals, it closes with a chapter on previous
  attempts to model semantic transparency. The second part introduces new empirical
  work on semantic transparency, introducing two different sets of statistical models
  for compound transparency. In particular, two semantic factors were explored: the
  semantic relations holding between compound constituents and the role of different
  readings of the constituents and the whole compound, operationalized in terms of
  meaning shifts and in terms of the distribution of specifc readings across constituent
  families. <br> All semantic annotations used in the book are freely available.'
