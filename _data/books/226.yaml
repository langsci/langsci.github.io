blurb: "Since the hiring of its first Africanist linguist Carleton Hodge in 1964,\
  \ Indiana University\x92s Department of Linguistics has had a strong and continuing\
  \ presence in the study of African languages and linguistics through the work of\
  \ its faculty and of its graduates on the faculties of many other universities.\
  \ Research on African linguistics at IU has covered some of the major language groups\
  \ spoken on the African continent. Carleton Hodge\x92s work on Ancient Egyptian\
  \ and Hausa, Paul Newman\x92s work on Hausa and Chadic languages, and Roxanna Ma\
  \ Newman\x92s work on Hausa language structure and pedagogy have been some of the\
  \ most important studies on Afro-Asiatic linguistics. With respect to Niger-Congo\
  \ languages, the work of Charles Bird on Bambara and the Mande languages, Robert\
  \ Botne\x92s work on Bantu structure (especially tense and aspect), Samuel Obeng\
  \ and Colin Painter\x92s work on Ghanaian Languages (phonetics, phonology, and pragmatics),\
  \ Robert Port\x92s studies on Swahili, and Erhard Voeltz's studies on Bantu linguistics\
  \ are considered some of the most influential studies in the sub-field. On Nilo\
  \ Saharan languages, the work of Tim Shopen on Songhay stands out. IU Linguistics\
  \ has also forwarded theoretical work on African languages, such as John Goldsmith\x92\
  s seminal research on tone in African languages. The African linguistics faculty\
  \ at IU have either founded or edited important journals in African Studies, African\
  \ languages, and African linguistics, including <em>Africa Today</em>,<em> Studies\
  \ in African Linguistics</em>, and<em> Journal of African Languages and Linguistics</em>.\r\
  \nIn 1972, the Indiana University Department of Linguistics hosted the <em>Third\
  \ Annual Conference of African Linguistics</em>. Proceedings of that conference\
  \ were published by Indiana University Publications (<em>African Series, vol</em>.<em>\
  \ 7</em>). In 1986, IU hosted the <em>Seventeenth Annual Conference of African Linguistics</em>\
  \ with Paul Newman and Robert Botne editing the proceedings in a volume entitled\
  \ <em>Current Approaches to African Linguistics,</em> <em>vol</em>.<em> 5</em>.\
  \ In 2016, Indiana University hosted the <em>48</em><sup><em>th</em></sup><em> Annual\
  \ Conference on African Linguistics</em> with the theme <em>African Linguistics\
  \ Across the Disciplines</em>. Proceedings of that meeting are published in this\
  \ volume.\r\nThe papers presented in this volume reflect the diversity of opportunities\
  \ for language study in Africa. This collection of descriptive and theoretical work\
  \ is the fruit of data gathering both in-country and abroad by researchers of languages\
  \ spoken across the continent, from Sereer-sin in the west to Somali in the northeast\
  \ to Ikalanga in the south. The range of topics in this volume is also broad, representative\
  \ of the varied field work in country and abroad that inspires research in African\
  \ linguistics. This collection of papers spans the disciplines of phonology (both\
  \ segmental and suprasegmental), morphology (both morphophonological and morphosyntactic),\
  \ syntax, semantics, and language policy. The data and analyses presented in this\
  \ volume offer a cross-disciplinary view of linguistic topics from the many under-resourced\
  \ languages of Africa."

      University. His research focuses on the phonetics and phonology of under- and
      un-documented languages, consonant-pitch interaction, sociolinguistic and dialectal
      variation, and community building in language documentation.</p>']
  - [Silvina, '', Bongiovanni, '<p>Silvina Bongiovanni is an Assistant Professor&nbsp;in
      the Department of Romance and Classical Studies at Michigan State University.
      She&nbsp;received a dual PhD in Linguistics and Hispanic Linguistics from Indiana
      University where she also received her MA in Hispanic Linguistics.&nbsp;Her
      work centers on phonetic and phonological variation and seeks to understand
      how the complex connections between physical instantiation, linguistic&nbsp;interpretation,
      and phonotactic distribution of sounds come together to shape linguistic variation.
      In her primary line of research, she examines within- and across-regional patterns
      of variation&nbsp;in nasality, both in vowels and in consonants,&nbsp;with dialects
      at different stages of sound change.&nbsp;</p>']
  - [Phillip, '', Weirich, '<p>Phillip Weirich is a PhD candidate in Linguistics at
      Indiana University. He studies dialectology and language attitudes, focusing
      on the interface of sociophonetic variation and beliefs about variation. His
      dissertation considers language variation across the state of Indiana and the
      effect that such variation has on individual patterns of speech perception and
      production.</p>']
