blurb: "This grammar provides a synchronic grammatical description of Mauwake, a Papuan\
  \ Trans-New Guinea (TNG) language of about 2000 speakers on the north coast of the\
  \ Madang Province in Papua New Guinea. It is the first book-length treatment of\
  \ the Mauwake language and the only published grammar of the Kumil subgroup to date.\
  \ Relying on other existing published and unpublished grammars, the author shows\
  \ how the language is similar to, or different from, related TNG languages especially\
  \ in the Madang province. \n\nThe grammar gives a brief introduction to the Mauwake\
  \ people, their environment and their culture. Although the book mainly covers morphology\
  \ and syntax, it also includes ashort treatment of the phonological system and the\
  \ orthography. The description of the grammatical units proceeds from the words/morphology\
  \ to the phrases, clauses, sentence types and clause combinations. The chapter on\
  \ functional domains is the only one where the organization is based on meaning/function\
  \ rather than structure.  The longest chapter in the book is on morphology, with\
  \ verbs taking the central stage. The final chapter deals with the pragmatic functions\
  \ theme, topic and focus.   \n\n13 texts by native speakers, mostly recorded and\
  \ transcribed but some originally written, are included in the Appendix with morpheme-by-morpheme\
  \ glosses and a free translation.\n\nThe theoretical approach used is that of Basic\
  \ Linguistic Theory. Language typologists and professional Papuanist linguists are\
  \ naturally one target audience for the grammar. But also two other possible, and\
  \ important, audiences influenced especially the style the writing: well educated\
  \ Mauwake speakers interested in their language, and those other Papua New Guineans\
  \ who have some basic training in linguistics and are keen to explore their own\
  \ languages."
