blurb: '<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family:
  Helvetica,serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This book presents a major leap
  forward in the understanding of colour by showing how richer descriptions of colour
  samples can be operationalized in agent-based models. Four different language strategies
  are explored: the basic colour strategy, the graded membership strategy, the category
  combination strategy and the basic modification strategy. These strategies are firmly
  rooted in empirical observations in natural languages, with a focus on compositionality
  at both the syntactic and semantic level. Through a series of in-depth experiments,
  this book discerns the impact of the environment, language and embodiment on the
  formation of basic colour systems. Finally, the experiments demonstrate how language
  users can invent their own language strategies of increasing complexity by combining
  primitive cognitive operators, and how these strategies can be aligned between language
  users through linguistic interactions.</span></span></span>'
