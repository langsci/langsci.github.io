blurb: '<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;">This book
  presents an in-depth linguistic description of Papuan Malay, a non-standard variety
  of Malay. The language is spoken in coastal West Papua which covers the western
  part of the island of New Guinea. The study is based on sixteen hours of recordings
  of spontaneous narratives and conversations between Papuan Malay speakers, recorded
  in the Sarmi area on the northeast coast of West Papua. Papuan Malay is the language
  of wider communication and the first or second language for an ever-increasing number
  of people of the area. While Papuan Malay is not officially recognized and therefore
  not used in formal government or educational settings or for religious preaching,
  it is used in all other domains, including unofficial use in formal settings, and,
  to some extent, in the public media. After a general introduction to the language,
  its setting, and history, this grammar discusses the following topics, building
  up from smaller grammatical constituents to larger ones: phonology, word formation,
  noun and prepositional phrases, verbal and nonverbal clauses, non-declarative clauses,
  and conjunctions and constituent combining. Of special interest to linguists, typologists,
  and Malay specialists are the following in-depth analyses and descriptions: affixation
  and its productivity across domains of language choice, reduplication and its gesamtbedeutung,
  personal pronouns and their adnominal uses, demonstratives and locatives and their
  extended uses, and adnominal possessive relations and their non- canonical uses.
  This study provides a starting point for Papuan Malay language development efforts
  and a point of comparison for further studies on other Malay varieties.'
