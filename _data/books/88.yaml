blurb: '"Thoughts on grammaticalization" was first published in a working-paper

  version in 1982 and became very influential immediately, even though it

  was properly published only in 1995. Despite its modest title, the book

  can be read as an advanced introduction to grammaticalization, though

  its conception is very original. The present edition contains a number

  of corrections of the 1995 edition. After a short review of the history

  of research, the work introduces and delimits the concepts related to

  grammaticalization. It then provides extensive exemplification of

  grammaticalization phenomena in diverse languages, ordered by

  grammatical domains such as the verbal, pronominal and nominal sphere

  and clause level relations. The final chapter presents a theory of

  grammaticalization which is based on the autonomy of the linguistic sign

  with respect to the paradigmatic and syntagmatic axes. This is the basis

  of the structural parameters that constitute grammaticalization. They

  are operationalized to the point of rendering degrees of

  grammaticalization measurable.'
