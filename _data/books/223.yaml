blurb: "The many facets of grammatical gender remain one of the most fruitful areas\
  \ of linguistic research, and pose fascinating questions about the origins and development\
  \ of complexity in language. The present work is a two-volume collection of 13 chapters\
  \ on the topic of grammatical gender seen through the prism of linguistic complexity.\
  \ The contributions discuss what counts as complex and/or simple in grammatical\
  \ gender systems, whether the distribution of gender systems across the world\x92\
  s languages relates to the language ecology and social history of speech communities.\
  \ Contributors demonstrate how the complexity of gender systems can be studied synchronically,\
  \ both in individual languages and over large cross-linguistic samples, and diachronically,\
  \ by exploring how gender systems change over time. In addition to three chapters\
  \ on the theoretical foundations of gender complexity, volume one contains six chapters\
  \ on grammatical gender and complexity in individual languages and language families\
  \ of Africa, New Guinea, and South Asia.\r\nThis volume is complemented by <a href=\"\
  http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/237\">volume two</a>, which consists of three\
  \ chapters providing diachronic and typological case studies, followed by a final\
  \ chapter discussing old and new theoretical and empirical challenges in the study\
  \ of the dynamics of gender complexity."

  - [Francesca, '', Di Garbo, '<p>Francesca Di Garbo is a postdoctoral research fellow
      in General Linguistics at Stockholm University. She received a BA in Classics
      (2005) and an MA in Classical Philology and Historical Linguistics (2007) at
      the University of Palermo (Italy). In 2014, she received her PhD in Linguistics
      at Stockholm University (Sweden). Her doctoral dissertation is a typological
      investigation of gender and its interaction with number and evaluative morphology
      in the languages of Africa. Her publications include papers on: the typology
      of interactions between gender and number, and gender and evaluative morphology;
      the encoding of evaluative morphology and temperature evaluation in the Kwa
      language Selee, spoken in Ghana; linguistic complexity, with focus on grammatical
      gender and the relationship between language structures and social structures.
      She has taught at&nbsp;Stockholm University and the University of Helsinki.
      Her research interests include the synchronic and diachronic typology of nominal
      classification systems and number systems, evaluative morphology, African languages,
      linguistic complexity, and the relationship between language structure and the
      socio-historical and natural environment.</p>']
  - [Bruno, '', Olsson, '<p>Bruno Olsson is a postdoctoral research fellow at the
      Australian National University. After completing an MA thesis on iamitive tense/aspect
      markers in Southeast Asian languages at Stockholm University (2013), Bruno pursued
      doctoral studies at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, resulting in
      a description of the Coastal Marind language of New Guinea (2017). His current
      work includes descriptive and historical work on other languages of the Anim
      family, with emphasis on the Yaqay language and the development of the Anim
      gender systems. Some of his other research interests are morphosyntax, the semantics
      of tense-aspect categories, the typology of Papuan languages, and Kashaya (a
      language of Northern California).</p>']
