blurb: "An ability to speak Jamaican Standard English is the stated requirement for\
  \ any managerial or frontline position in corporate Jamaica. This research looks\
  \ at the phonological variation that occurs in the formal speech of this type of\
  \ employee, and focuses on the specific cohort chosen to represent Jamaica in interactions\
  \ with local and international clients. The variation that does emerge, shows both\
  \ the presence of some features traditionally characterized as Creole and a clear\
  \ avoidance of other features found in basilectal and mesolectal Jamaican. Some\
  \ phonological items are prerequisites for \x93good English\x94 - variables that\
  \ define the user as someone who speaks English - even if other Creole variants\
  \ are present. The ideologies of language and language use that Jamaican speakers\
  \ hold about \x93good English\x94 clearly reflect the centuries-old coexistence\
  \ of English and Creole, and suggest local norms must be our starting point for\
  \ discussing the acrolect."
