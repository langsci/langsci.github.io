blurb: '<p style="clear:both">What causes a language to be the way it is? Some features
  are universal, some are inherited, others are borrowed, and yet others are internally
  innovated. But no matter where a bit of language is from, it will only exist if
  it has been diffused and kept in circulation through social interaction in the history
  of a community. This book makes the case that a proper understanding of the ontology
  of language systems has to be grounded in the causal mechanisms by which linguistic
  items are socially transmitted, in communicative contexts. A biased transmission
  model provides a basis for understanding why certain things and not others are likely
  to develop, spread, and stick in languages.


  Because bits of language are always parts of systems, we also need to show how it
  is that items of knowledge and behavior become structured wholes. The book argues
  that to achieve this, we need to see how causal processes apply in multiple frames
  or ''time scales'' simultaneously, and we need to understand and address each and
  all of these frames in our work on language. This forces us to confront implications
  that are not always comfortable: for example, that "a language" is not a real thing
  but a convenient fiction, that language-internal and language-external processes
  have a lot in common, and that tree diagrams are poor conceptual tools for understanding
  the history of languages. By exploring avenues for clear solutions to these problems,
  this book suggests a conceptual framework for ultimately explaining, in causal terms,
  what languages are like and why they are like that.
