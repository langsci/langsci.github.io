blurb: "This monograph investigates structural aspects of Italian particle verbs,\
  \ a<br>grammatical phenomenon that has attracted interest from a variety of research\
  \ threads in the last decade. By means of a scrutiny of lexical, syntactic, semantic,\
  \ argument-structural and prosodic properties of both the verb-particle unit and\
  \ the particle in a wide range of constructions, new light is shed on crucial issues\
  \ like the categorial status of the particle, the interaction of verb and particle\
  \ at argument structure and the structural cohesion displayed by verb and particle\
  \ in constituency. The proposed analysis is couched in the architecture of Lexical-Functional\
  \ Grammar, and is motivated by a systematic comparison between Italian on the one\
  \ hand and Germanic languages like English, German and Swedish on the other. The\
  \ results of the investigation bear relevance to a classic problem of verb-particle\
  \ constructions, namely whether they are a product of syntactic or morphological\
  \ structure building. It is argued that Italian particle verbs are not represented\
  \ as single words at any level of grammatical representation where the concept of\
  \ \x93word\x94 is relevant. In particular, they qualify as syntactic, and not as\
  \ morphological structures. This, in turn, suggests that the properties of Italian\
  \ particle verbs do not provide a strong argument in favor of approaches advocating\
  \ the existence of a continuum between morphology and syntax instead of their representation\
  \ as separate components."
