blurb: "The volume contains a selection of papers originally presented at the symposium\
  \ on \x93Areal patterns of grammaticalization and cross-linguistic variation in\
  \ grammaticalization scenarios\x94 held on 12-14 March 2015 at Johannes Gutenberg\
  \ University of Mainz. The papers, written by leading scholars combining expertise\
  \ in historical linguistics and grammaticalization research, study variation in\
  \ grammaticalization scenarios in a variety of language families (Slavic, Indo-Aryan,\
  \ Tibeto-Burman, Bantu, Mande, \"Khoisan\", Siouan, and Mayan). The volume stands\
  \ out in the vast literature on grammaticalization by focusing on variation in grammaticalization\
  \ scenarios and areal patterns in grammaticalization. Apart from documenting new\
  \ grammaticalization paths, the volume makes a methodological contribution as it\
  \ addresses an important question of how to reconcile universal outcomes of grammaticalization\
  \ processes with the fact that the input to these processes is language-specific\
  \ and construction-specific."

      \ grammaticalization, linguistic contact and linguistic complexity. The combination\
      \ of this research together with his findings on East and mainland Southeast\
      \ Asian languages led him to the claim that grammaticalization is subject to\
      \ cross-linguistic variation in terms of its properties as well as in terms\
      \ of at least some pathways. His papers cover a wide range of phenomena, among\
      \ them classifiers and classification, serial verb constructions, clause combining,\
      \ finiteness, parts of speech, radical pro-drop and morphological paradigms.\
