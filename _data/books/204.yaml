blurb: "The annual workshop on multiword expressions takes place since 2001 in conjunction\
  \ with major computational linguistics conferences and attracts the attention of\
  \ an ever-growing community working on a variety of languages, linguistic phenomena\
  \ and related computational processing issues. MWE 2017 took place in Valencia,\
  \ Spain, and represented a vibrant panorama of the current research landscape on\
  \ the computational treatment of multiword expressions, featuring many high-quality\
  \ submissions. Furthermore, MWE 2017 included the first shared task on multilingual\
  \ identification of verbal multiword expressions. The shared task, with extended\
  \ communal work, has developed important multilingual resources and mobilised several\
  \ research groups in computational linguistics worldwide.\r\nThis book contains\
  \ extended versions of selected papers from the workshop. Authors worked hard to\
  \ include detailed explanations, broader and deeper analyses, and new exciting results,\
  \ which were thoroughly reviewed by an internationally renowned committee. We hope\
  \ that this distinctly joint effort will provide a meaningful and useful snapshot\
  \ of the multilingual state of the art in multiword expressions modelling and processing,\
  \ and will be a point point of reference for future work."
