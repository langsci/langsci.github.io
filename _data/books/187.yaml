blurb: "Historically a dubbing country, Germany is not well-known for subtitled productions.\
  \ But while dubbing is predominant in Germany, more and more German viewers prefer\
  \ original and subtitled versions of their favourite shows and films. Conventional\
  \ subtitling, however, can be seen as a strong intrusion into the original image\
  \ that can not only disrupt but also destroy the director\x92s intended shot composition\
  \ and focus points. Long eye movements between focus points and subtitles decrease\
  \ the viewer\x92s information intake, and especially German audiences, who are often\
  \ not used to subtitles, seem to prefer to wait for the next subtitle instead of\
  \ looking back up again. Furthermore, not only the placement, but also the overall\
  \ design of conventional subtitles can disturb the image composition \x96 for instance\
  \ titles with a weak contrast, inappropriate typeface or irritating colour system.\r\
  \nSo should it not, despite the translation process, be possible to preserve both\
  \ image and sound as far as possible? Especially given today\x92s numerous artistic\
  \ and technical possibilities and the huge amount of work that goes into the visual\
  \ aspects of a film, taking into account not only special effects, but also typefaces,\
  \ opening credits and text-image compositions. A further development of existing\
  \ subtitling guidelines would not only express respect towards the original film\
  \ version but also the translator\x92s work.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe presented study shows\
  \ how integrated titles can increase information intake while maintaining the intended\
  \ image composition and focus points as well as the aesthetics of the shot compositions.\
  \ During a three-stage experiment, the specifically for this purpose created integrated\
  \ titles in the documentary \x93Joining the Dots\x94 by director Pablo Romero-Fresco\
  \ were analysed with the help of eye movement data from more than 45 participants.\
  \ Titles were placed based on the gaze behaviour of English native speakers and\
  \ then rated by German viewers dependant on a German translation.\r\nThe results\
  \ show that a reduction of the distance between intended focus points and titles\
  \ allow the viewers more time to explore the image and connect the titles to the\
  \ plot. The integrated titles were rated as more aesthetically pleasing and reading\
  \ durations were shorter than with conventional subtitles. Based on the analysis\
  \ of graphic design and filmmaking rules as well as conventional subtitling standards,\
  \ a first workflow and set of placement strategies for integrated titles were created\
  \ in order to allow a more respectful handling of film material as well as the preservation\
  \ of the original image composition and typographic film identity."
