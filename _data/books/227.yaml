blurb: 'Definiteness has been a central topic in theoretical semantics since its modern
  foundation. However, despite its significance, there has been surprisingly scarce
  research on its cross-linguistic expression. With the purpose of contributing to
  filling this gap, the present volume gathers thirteen studies exploiting insights
  from formal semantics and syntax, typological and language specific studies, and,
  crucially, semantic fieldwork and cross-linguistic semantics, in order to address
  the expression and interpretation of definiteness in a diverse group of languages,
  most of them understudied. The papers presented in this volume aim to establish
  a dialogue between theory and data in order to answer the following questions: What
  formal strategies do natural languages employ to encode definiteness? What are the
  possible meanings associated to this notion across languages? Are there different
  types of definite reference? Which other functions (besides marking definite reference)
  are associated with definite descriptions? Each of the papers contained in this
  volume addresses at least one of these questions and, in doing so, they aim to enrich
  our understanding of definiteness.'
