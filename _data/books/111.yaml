blurb: This study makes substantial contributions to both the theoretical and computational
  treatment of information structure, with a specific focus on creating natural language
  processing applications such as multilingual machine translation systems. The present
  study first provides cross-linguistic findings in regards to information structure
  meanings and markings. Building upon such findings, the current model represents
  information structure within the HPSG/MRS framework using Individual Constraints.
  The primary goal of the present study is to create a multilingual grammar model
  of information structure for the LinGO Grammar Matrix system. The present study
  explores the construction of a grammar library for creating customized grammar incorporating
  information structure and illustrates how the information structure-based model
  improves performance of transfer-based machine translation.

  - [Sanghoun, '', Song, '<p>Sanghoun Song (1977) is specialized in grammar engineering
      based on the HPSG and MRS formalism. He graduated from Korea University in Seoul,
      where he earned his BA and MA degree in linguistics. He received a PhD in linguistics
      from University of Washington in Seattle. Afterwards, he worked at the computational
      linguistics lab. at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore as a research
      fellow. Now, he is an assistant professor at Incheon National University. His
      research interests include grammatical theory (the theory of computational grammar
      from a cross-linguistic perspective), experimental syntax (the use of acceptability
      judgments as evidence for linguistic theories), and corpus linguistics (the
      use of data-based methods to capture linguistic phenomena in human languages).</p>']
