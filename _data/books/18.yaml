blurb: A typological study of the rare marked-S language type which overtly marks
  the single argument of intransitive verbs (S) while one of the arguments of transitive
  verbs (either A or P) is left zero-coded. The formal (overt versus zero-coding)
  as well as functional aspects (range of uses of individual case forms) of the phenomenon
  are treated. The book covers languages from the Afro-Asiatic and Nilo-Saharan languages
  of Africa and of the North America Pacific Northwest and Pacific regions.
