blurb: "Information structure is a relatively new field to linguistics and has only\
  \ recently been studied for smaller and less described languages. This book is the\
  \ first of its kind that brings together contributions on information structure\
  \ in Austronesian languages. Current approaches from formal semantics, discourse\
  \ studies, and intonational phonology are brought together with language specific\
  \ and cross-linguistic expertise of Austronesian languages. The 13 chapters in this\
  \ volume cover all subgroups of the large Austronesian family, including Formosan,\
  \ Central Malayo-Polynesian, South Halmahera-West New Guinea, and Oceanic. The major\
  \ focus, though, lies on Western Malayo-Polynesian languages. Some chapters investigate\
  \ two of the largest languages in the region (Tagalog and different varieties of\
  \ Malay), others study information-structural phenomena in small, underdescribed\
  \ languages. The three overarching topics that are covered in this book are NP marking\
  \ and reference tracking devices, syntactic structures and information-structural\
  \ categories, and the interaction of information structure and prosody. Various\
  \ data types build the basis for the different studies compiled in this book. Some\
  \ chapters investigate written texts, such as modern novels (cf. Djenar\x92s chapter\
  \ on modern, standard Indonesian), or compare different text genres, such as, for\
  \ example, oral narratives and translations of biblical narratives (cf. De Busser\x92\
  s chapter on Bunun). Most contributions, however, study natural spoken speech and\
  \ make use of spoken corpora which have been compiled by the authors themselves.\
  \ The volume comprises a number of different methods and theoretical frameworks.\
  \ Two chapters make use of the Question Under Discussion approach, developed in\
  \ formal semantics (cf. the chapters by Latrouite &amp; Riester; Shiohara &amp;\
  \ Riester). Riesberg et al. apply the recently developed method of Rapid Prosody\
  \ Transcription (RPT) to investigate native speakers\x92 perception of prosodic\
  \ prominences and boundaries in Papuan Malay. Other papers discuss theoretical consequences\
  \ of their findings. Thus, for example, Himmelmann takes apart the most widespread\
  \ framework for intonational phonology (ToBI) and argues that the analysis of Indonesian\
  \ languages requires much simpler assumptions than the ones underlying the standard\
  \ model. Arka &amp; Sedeng ask the question how fine-grained information structure\
  \ space should be conceptualized and modelled, e.g. in LFG. Schnell argues that\
  \ elements that could be analysed as \x93topic\x94 and \x93focus\x94 categories,\
  \ should better be described in terms of \x91packaging\x92 and do not necessarily\
  \ reflect any pragmatic roles in the first place."

      study of the voice systems of four Austronesian languages (Totoli, Balinese,
      Indonesian, and Tagalog) and the theoretical challenges that these systems impose
      on syntactic theories. Her recent work on western Austronesian focuses on prominence
      related structures in prosody and morphosyntax. Since 2012 she has also done
      extensive field work on Yali (Trans-New Guinea) and has been strongly involved
      in language documentation and capacity building measures in West Papua.</p>']

      language, and Tonsawang, which is one of the Minahasan languages.&nbsp;She also
      works on Standard Indonesian as well as colloquial Malay varieties in Indonesia.
      Her work on minority languages covers the areas of phonetics, morphology, syntax,
      semantics, and discourse analysis, that on Malay varieties mainly focuses on
      discourse analysis.&nbsp;</p>']
