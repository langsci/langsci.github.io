blurb: "This book presents an in-depth description of information structure in Isthmus\
  \ Zapotec, an Otomanguean language spoken by around 50,000 people in southeastern\
  \ Oaxaca, Mexico, and represents the first book-length treatment of information\
  \ structure in a Mesoamerican language. Three main observations motivate the study:\r\
  \n<ol>\r\n<li>Strong documentation and a relatively large and active speaker community\
  \ create a unique opportunity to document information structure in Isthmus Zapotec\
  \ and to study the language as it is used by speakers in everyday life;</li>\r\n\
  <li>As a tonal and verb-initial language, the examination of Isthmus Zapotec represents\
  \ a chance to explore the possible combinations of tone, intonation, morphology\
  \ and verb-initial syntax that may occur in the coding of information structure;\
  \ and</li>\r\n<li>The close analysis of spontaneous speech in an endangered language\
  \ contributes to our theoretical understanding of information structure and informs\
  \ our knowledge of language documentation practices and revitalization efforts.</li>\r\
  \n</ol>\r\nOverall, the analysis presented here demonstrates the value and need\
  \ for information structure studies to document and analyze naturally-occurring\
  \ data."
