blurb: 'Sanzhi Dargwa belongs to the Dargwa (Dargi) languages (ISO dar; Glottocode
  darg1242) which form a subgroup of the Nakh-Daghestanian language family. Sanzhi
  Dargwa is spoken by approximately 250 speakers and is severely endangered. This
  book is the first comprehensive descriptive grammar of Sanzhi, written from a typological
  perspective. It treats all major levels of grammar (phonology, morphology, syntax)
  and also information structure. Sanzhi Dargwa is structurally similar to other East
  Caucasian languages, in particular Dargwa languages. It has a relatively large consonant
  inventory including pharyngeal and ejective consonants. Sanzhi morphology is concatenative
  and mainly suffixing. The language exhibits a mixture of dependent-marking in the
  form of a rich case inventory and head-marking in the form of verbal agreement.
  Nouns are divided into three genders. Verbal inflection conflates tense/aspect/mood/evidentiality
  in a rich array of synthetic and analytic verb forms as well as participles, converbs,
  a masdar, and infinitive and some other forms used in analytic tenses and subordinate
  clauses. Salient traits of the grammar are two independently operating agreement
  systems: gender/number agreement and person agreement. Within the nominal domain,
  modifiers agree with the head nominal in gender/number. Agreement within the clausal
  domain is mainly controlled by the argument in the absolutive case. Person agreement
  operates only at the clausal level and according to the person hierarchy 1, 2 &gt;
  3. Sanzhi has ergative alignment in the form of gender/number agreement and ergative
  case marking. The most frequent word order at the clause level is APV, though all
  other logically possible word orders are also attested. In subordinate clauses,
  word order is almost exclusively head-final.'
