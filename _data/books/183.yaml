blurb: This book presents a collection of pioneering papers reflecting current methods
  in prosody research with a focus on Romance languages. The rapid expansion of the
  field of prosody research in the last decades has given rise to a proliferation
  of methods that has left little room for the critical assessment of these methods.
  The aim of this volume is to bridge this gap by embracing original contributions,
  in which experts in the field assess, reflect, and discuss different methods of
  data gathering and analysis. The book might thus be of interest to scholars and
  established researchers as well as to students and young academics who wish to explore
  the topic of prosody, an expanding and promising area of study.
