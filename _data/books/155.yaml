blurb: "Many researchers assume that the relation between morphology and phonology\
  \ is not a direct one but is modulated by prosodic constituents, particularly the\
  \ phonological word. Despite the theoretical relevance of the phonological word\
  \ in morphophonology, phonetic investigations of the realization of (complex) words\
  \ are still rare. The book aims to shed some light on this issue. On the basis of\
  \ about 3800 tokens from experimentally elicited and spontaneous&nbsp; German speech,\
  \ it investigates the prosodic boundary phenomena glottal stop insertion / glottalization\
  \ and degemination, as well as durational reductions and /t/-deletions in the vicinity\
  \ of a morphological and/or prosodic boundary. Informed by findings from usage-based\
  \ accounts of language, it systematically introduces token frequency and other potentially\
  \ influencing factors into the analysis. The results yield a rather complex picture\
  \ that, on the whole, corroborates the relevance of the phonological word as an\
  \ interface domain between morphology and phonology. At the same time, the results\
  \ underline the necessity to consider usage-based factors such as frequency, thus\
  \ all in all lending support to so-called hybrid models of language.\r\n&nbsp;\r\
