blurb: "The syllable is a natural unit of organization in spoken language whose strongest\
  \ cross-linguistic patterns are often explained in terms of a universal preference\
  \ for the CV structure. Syllable patterns involving long sequences of consonants\
  \ are both typologically rare and theoretically marginalized, with few approaches\
  \ treating these as natural or unproblematic structures. This book is an investigation\
  \ of the properties of languages with highly complex syllable patterns. The two\
  \ aims are (i) to establish whether these languages share other linguistic features\
  \ in common such that they constitute a distinct linguistic type, and (ii) to identify\
  \ possible diachronic paths and natural mechanisms by which these patterns come\
  \ about in the history of a language. These issues are investigated in a diversified\
  \ sample of 100 languages, 25 of which have highly complex syllable patterns.\r\n\
  Languages with highly complex syllable structure are characterized by a number of\
  \ phonetic, phonological, and morphological features which serve to set them apart\
  \ from languages with simpler syllable patterns. These include specific segmental\
  \ and suprasegmental properties, a higher prevalence of vowel reduction processes\
  \ with extreme outcomes, and higher average morpheme/word ratios. The results suggest\
  \ that highly complex syllable structure is a linguistic type distinct from but\
  \ sharing some characteristics with other proposed holistic phonological types,\
  \ including stress-timed and consonantal languages. The results point to word stress\
  \ and specific patterns of gestural organization as playing important roles in the\
  \ diachronic development of these patterns out of simpler syllable structures."
